## M17 Kickoff Prerequisites

**Release branch:** `release/m17` — ✅ CUT 2026-06-25 from `main` at commit d806957
**Sprint plan:** ✅ FILED + EL APPROVED 2026-06-25 — `docs/process/sprint-plans/m17-sprint-plan.md`

| Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. EL merges `release/m16` → `main` (admin bypass) | ✅ DONE 2026-06-25 | PR #1259 merged |
| 2. PM Agent cuts `release/m17` from updated `main` | ✅ DONE 2026-06-25 | `release/m17` cut at commit d806957 |
| 3. PM Agent authors `m17-sprint-plan.md` with Wave 1/Wave 2 structure | ✅ DONE 2026-06-25 | Wave 1 = CM calibration sprint; Wave 2 = DEMO6 CRITICAL + comparative infrastructure; hard gate between waves |
| 4. EL approves sprint plan | ✅ EL APPROVED 2026-06-25 | Design phases may begin immediately; G1 sprint entry required before Wave 1 begins |
| 5. #982 exit checklist confirmed as M17 gate issue | ✅ DONE 2026-06-25 | Renamed to "M17 Exit Checklist — blocks milestone closure"; assigned to GitHub Milestone 18 |
| 6. Wave 1 sprint entry (G1) filed and EL-approved | ✅ EL APPROVED 2026-06-25 | `docs/process/sprint-plans/m17-g1-sprint-entry.md`; CM active on #1229 + #1248; Wave 1 begins |

**Critical prerequisite: M17 Wave 2 may not begin until Wave 1 exits.** Wave 1 exit gate: FRAME-D milestone sentence fires within an 8-step programme window on the Demo 6 Senegal scenario after the elasticity calibration change. DemographicModule ELASTICITY_REGISTRY updated with CM-certified values. Governance calibration specification on record.

**M17 kickoff COMPLETE. G1 WAVE 1 EXIT GATE CONFIRMED 2026-06-25.** PR #1270 merged 2026-06-25. ELASTICITY_REGISTRY revised: Q1 informal −0.20, Q2 informal −0.133, Q1 agricultural −0.16 (all T3, Fosu 2011 SSA calibration). Fosu 2011 source seeded in source_registry (migration a3b5d7f9e2c1). Governance sensitivity spec filed (docs/calibration/m17-g1-governance-sensitivity-specification.md — three CM positions: Q1 working-as-designed, Q2 institutional capacity deferred to Wave 2 with data precondition, Q3 working-as-designed with transparency disclosure recommended). FRAME-D tests pass in CI (test-backend green on PR #1270). Sprint exit doc filed: `docs/process/sprint-plans/m17-g1-sprint-exit.md`. BPO supplemental assessment: #1229 ACCEPT + #1248 ACCEPT (2026-06-25). PI Agent confirmation: CONFIRMED — all Wave 1 exit conditions satisfied. **Wave 2 implementation sprint entries now unblocked.** PM Agent HORIZON sweep actions complete 2026-06-25: #1275 (SEN institutional_capacity_index seed + GovernanceElasticity, Wave 2), #1276 (Zone 1D governance horizon disclosure, Wave 2), #1277 (sprint-planning-sop.md UX/UI design artifact gate amendment, M17). Insights log entry 13 promoted → #1277.

## Mid-Milestone Main Sync — 2026-06-23

**PR #1133** — EL merged `release/m15` → `main` 2026-06-23. Mid-milestone sync. G1–G6 complete.
**PR #1140** — EL merged `release/m15` → `main` 2026-06-23. Mid-milestone sync. G7 complete + G8 deferral decision.
**PR #1142** — EL merged `release/m15` → `main` 2026-06-23. Final M15 sync — exit ceremony artifacts. M15 CLOSED.

**State at sync point:** G1/G2/G3/G4/G5/G6 complete (all sprint exits filed). G7 and G8 sprint entries not yet filed. `release/m15` continues as the active release branch — all future G-group feature work continues to target `release/m15`.

**NM-056 filed:** E2E test soft-skip masked AC-4 mock bug for 8 sprints. Root cause: `null ?? 2` in `makeTrajectoryMock` + backend startup failure before PR #1123 made tests soft-skip silently. Fixed in PR #1130. Full record: `docs/process/near-miss-registry.md §NM-056`.

## HORIZON Sweep — 2026-06-25

**Open issues reviewed:** 5 (insights log entries 8–12 — all filed since 2026-06-24)
**Disposition:**
- Entry 8 (2026-06-24, fiscal-to-cohort elasticity calibration gap): **promoted → #1229** — filed during G8 Step 5b; CM-owned M17 Wave 1 scope; DemographicModule ELASTICITY_REGISTRY revision; already tracked in CLAUDE.md §M17
- Entry 9 (2026-06-24, Zone 1B proportional allocation): **promoted → #1252** — filed during M16 exit ceremony PR #1257; M17 Wave 2 scope; ADR-017 amendment or new ADR required; already tracked in CLAUDE.md §M17
- Entry 10 (2026-06-24, Demo 7 opening arc): **hold** — not yet actionable as a discrete issue; Demo 7 narrative is scenario planning context for sprint plan authorship; actionable dependencies (#1229 calibration, Mode 3 north star) are both tracked; leave open until M17 Wave 2 sprint planning
- Entry 11 (2026-06-24, governance calibration gap): **promoted → #1248** — filed during M16 exit ceremony PR #1257; CM-owned M17 Wave 1 scope; GovernanceModule fiscal conditionality transmission; already tracked in CLAUDE.md §M17
- Entry 12 (2026-06-25, #843 deferral EL decision): **resolved** — EL decision fully recorded in SESSION_STATE.md exit ceremony, CLAUDE.md §M16+M17, and #843 GitHub issue moved to M17; all required artifact updates complete

**New issues filed this sweep:**
- None — all promoted entries were filed during M16 exit ceremony (PR #1257) or G8 Step 5b sprint work; DEMO6 high/medium/low findings remain reference material until M17 Wave 2 scope planning

**Process gaps identified:**
- **M17 kickoff prerequisites all complete as of 2026-06-25.** Steps 1–4 done: (1) EL merged `release/m16` → `main` (PR #1259); (2) PM Agent cut `release/m17`; (3) PM Agent authored `m17-sprint-plan.md` (v3); (4) EL approved sprint plan 2026-06-25. Design phases (G2 Phase 1, G3 Phase 1, G4 visual specs) may begin immediately. G1 sprint entry required before Wave 1 begins.
- No near-misses to file. No new ADR backlog assignments required at this sweep.

**M17 kickoff status at sweep time (updated at EL approval):**
- `release/m17`: ✅ cut 2026-06-25 from `main` at d806957
- `m17-sprint-plan.md`: ✅ filed 2026-06-25 (v3, EL-directed revisions)
- EL sprint plan approval: ✅ APPROVED 2026-06-25
- #982 (M17 Exit Checklist): ✅ renamed 2026-06-25
- Wave 1 issues in scope: #1229 (fiscal elasticity, CM-owned), #1248 (governance sensitivity, CM-owned)
- Wave 1 exit gate: FRAME-D milestone sentence fires within 8-step Demo 6 window after CM-certified ELASTICITY_REGISTRY change
- Wave 2 gate: blocked until Wave 1 exits; Wave 2 scope: #394 (multi-scenario comparison), #1249/#1250/#1253 (DEMO6 CRITICAL polish), #1251 (adaptive y-axis extension), #1252 (Zone 1B proportional allocation)

## HORIZON Sweep — 2026-06-23

**Open issues reviewed:** 1 (insights log entry 7 — AC-001/AC-002 founding document addition)
**Disposition:**
- Entry 7 (2026-06-21, founding document AC-001/AC-002): **promoted → #1145** — EL-authored documentation task; action is clear and actionable; filed for M16 scope

**New issues filed this sweep:**
| Issue | Title | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| #1145 | docs(founding): add AC-001 and AC-002 as explicit permanent constraints in founding document | Promoted from insights log entry 7 |

**Process gaps identified:**
- None. M15 exit ceremony complete; M16 kickoff prerequisites not yet started (release/m16 not cut; sprint plan not filed).

**M16 kickoff status at sweep time:**
- release/m16 branch: not yet cut
- m16-sprint-plan.md: not yet filed
- EL approval: not yet received
- #985 rename: pending (currently "Milestone 17 Exit Checklist" — recommend rename to "M16 Exit Checklist")
- ARCH-012 backlog assignment: pending (confirm with Architect whether Zone 1A Phase 4 requires a new ADR review)

## HORIZON Sweep — 2026-06-20

**Open issues reviewed:** 1 (insights log entry 6 — CLAUDE.md structure)
**Disposition:**
- Entry 6 (2026-06-16, CLAUDE.md refactor): **promoted → #1091** — M14 has closed; deferral condition met; issue filed for M15 scope
- All other entries: previously promoted/resolved; no change

**New issues filed this sweep:**
| Issue | Title | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| #1088 | docs(demo): walkthrough update — "0 consecutive steps" plain-language (DEMO-123) | Slipped M14 close; required before #843 |
| #1089 | docs(demo): walkthrough update — Grounding strip persistence note (DEMO-124) | Slipped M14 close; required before #843 |
| #1090 | docs(demo): walkthrough update — methodology documentation URL (DEMO-129) | Slipped M14 close; required before #843 |
| #1091 | docs(claude-md): extract Lifecycle/Exit/DIC sections to child docs | Promoted from insights log entry 6 |

**Process gaps identified:**
- DEMO-123/124/129 walkthrough updates were due "before M14 close" per stakeholder review (session table row 182) but slipped. Filed as M15 issues above. Not a near-miss requiring NM entry — the M14 exit ceremony closed with EL acceptance; these are incremental improvements to walkthrough narration, not defects in the application.
- Issue #984 title naming discrepancy: "Milestone 16 Exit Checklist" vs. our convention "M15 Exit Checklist". Flagged for EL to confirm or request rename.

## M15 Exit Ceremony — 2026-06-23 (COMPLETE)

**Exit ceremony steps:**
| Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1 — Open issue audit | ✅ COMPLETE | 6 issues closed as delivered; 12 issues migrated to M16; only #984 remained |
| Step 2 — Milestone reference audit | ✅ COMPLETE | README, CLAUDE.md, roadmap all updated; v0.15.0 release created |
| Step 3 — SESSION_STATE consistency | ✅ COMPLETE | M16 open issues table added; M15 marked closed; stale roadmap refs (#35/#30 parking lot, Path 2 AC-001) fixed |
| Step 4 — Fresh session continuity | ✅ COMPLETE | No critical/high gaps; M16 kickoff prerequisites documented; #985 naming note recorded |

**Retrospective (mandatory):**
1. *Defects that evaded test suite:* The AC-4 mock null bug (`null ?? 2` in `makeTrajectoryMock`) evaded detection for 8 sprints because the test soft-skipped on backend startup failure (NM-056). Fixed in PR #1130. G4 test files were not included in implementation PRs and committed separately (NM-055). CM sign-off on #975 was filed post-implementation (NM-053).
2. *Process gaps:* (a) Soft-skip pattern masked test failures — now flagged via NM-056 process improvement. (b) QA test files must be in the same PR as implementation (NM-055). (c) CM sign-off must be pre-implementation for analytical scope items (NM-053).
3. *Testing improvements required before M16 close:* (a) Confirm no active soft-skip patterns in E2E suite before M16 exit. (b) Verify CM and DA sign-off artifacts exist before sprint entry for #986/#987.

**#984 (M15 exit checklist):** Closed at ceremony completion 2026-06-23.

- ✅ **G8 EL live-demo fixes PR #1233 merged 2026-06-24** — four EL-directed fixes: (1) Zone 1A scoring: is_single_entity bug fixed — cohort entities (`:CHT:` IDs) excluded from sovereign count at both trajectory and measurement-output endpoints; normalized_absolute strategy now active for SEN single-entity scenario so diverging curves visible; (2) 25-year panel: `currentStep` prop added to `HumanCapitalTrajectoryPanel`; useEffect re-fetches on each step advance so sparklines populate; (3) CohortImpactSection overflow: `minWidth: 0` on flex container + `display: block; overflow: hidden; textOverflow: ellipsis; whiteSpace: nowrap` on label spans; NM-063 filed; legibility spec `demo-legibility.spec.ts` extended with overflow check; (4) DEMO6-001/DEMO6-003 narration: Frame A updated to "approaching" framing; Frame D updated to structural intergenerational argument without referencing absent milestone sentence; DEMO6-002 (byte-identical frames) partially addressed — useEffect fix means Frame D will show sparklines after step advance; re-capture will determine if frames remain byte-identical
- ✅ **G8 Steps 6/6b re-run COMPLETE 2026-06-24** — PR #1235 merged to `release/m16`; cohort threshold crossings backend (Option A: `CohortThresholdCrossing` schema + `get_measurement_output` Q1/Q2 cumulative computation via MDA floor query); zone labels/borders (boxShadow:inset for AC-009 perf gate); 3 narration fixes (invisible 0.4x values removed); MDA alert panel restored in Zone 1B (minHeight:80 guarantee; M17 proportional allocation queued in insights log 2026-06-24); DEMO6-002 (Frame B=C byte-identical) → EL decision: deck annotation, no code change; all five frames re-captured: both MDA alert panel AND cohort crossings visible in Zone 1B at Steps 2 and 8
- ✅ **G8 Step 6b IR review COMPLETE 2026-06-25** — PR #1242 merged to `release/m16`; `docs/demo/m16/reviews/2026-06-24-v0.16.0-ir-review.md`; IR-001 (Zone 1A FIN/GOV overlap — adaptive y-axis fix required); IR-002 (25-year panel "no data" — expected behavior for pending scenario, no fix)
- ✅ **G8 IR-001 adaptive y-axis fix PR #1243 merged 2026-06-25** — `computeYDomain()` pure function added + exported; both recharts and CompositeChartSVG render paths updated; 7 new unit tests (all 31 pass); frontend build gate ✅; M17 governance calibration finding filed to insights-log (GOV barely responds to fiscal conditionality across 8 steps)
- ✅ **G8 Step 6 screenshots re-captured 2026-06-25** — five frames in `docs/demo/m16/screenshots/`; FIN/GOV curves now visually distinct after adaptive y-axis fix; FRAME-D WARNING remains (pre-existing calibration gap, M17 scope)
- ✅ **G8 Step 6c audience simulation PR #1244 merged 2026-06-25** — `docs/demo/m16/reviews/2026-06-25-v0.16.0-audience-simulation.md`; four persona agents (P1/P2/P3/P5); 36 findings DEMO6-014 through DEMO6-049 (4 CRITICAL / 11 HIGH / 13 MEDIUM / 5 LOW); **north star gate: CONDITIONAL PASS**; primary finding sentence on record; three mandatory presenter preparation items before Step 9
- ✅ **G8 CLOSES — preparatory work complete (EL decision 2026-06-25)** — Steps 1–6c delivered: demo scripts, walkthrough, narrated spec, screenshots, internal review, IR review, adaptive y-axis fix, audience simulation (DEMO6-001–049). Step 9 (live demo) deferred to M17/Demo 7 per EL decision. DEMO6 findings are the specification foundation for Demo 7 in M17. #843 moved to M17. M16 exit gate is now distributional visibility delivery (G1–G4/G6/G9/G10), not #843.

## M16 Exit Ceremony — 2026-06-25

**Exit ceremony steps:**
| Step | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Step 1 — Open issue audit | ✅ COMPLETE | 7 issues closed as delivered (#1147, #274, #97, #846, #153, #92, #1209); only #985 remains |
| Step 2 — Milestone reference audit | ✅ COMPLETE | README badge/status/table updated; CLAUDE.md §What We Are Building First + §Milestone Roadmap updated; roadmap all UNTRACKED entries replaced with issue numbers (PR #1257) |
| Step 3 — SESSION_STATE consistency | ✅ COMPLETE | Header and current milestone updated; M17 kickoff prerequisites section added; M17 open issues table with Wave 1/Wave 2 structure and #982 gate issue confirmed |
| Step 4 — Fresh session continuity | ✅ COMPLETE | M17 kickoff prerequisites section added; #982 renamed; Wave 1/Wave 2 gate explicitly documented; no critical/high gaps remain |

**Retrospective (mandatory):**

1. *Defects that evaded the test suite:*
   - **FRAME-D milestone sentence not visible in Demo 6 window** — surfaced at Step 5b (backend gate), not by the test suite. The DemographicModule elasticity calibration gap (`imf_program_acceptance` producing ~+0.0015pp/step) was not covered by any integration test that would have flagged the insufficient delta.
   - **Zone 1A FIN/GOV curve overlap (IR-001)** — the adaptive y-axis gap was caught by the IR review (Step 6b), not by any automated test. No Playwright assertion verified that FIN and GOV curves were visually distinguishable when their range was < 0.05.
   - **Zone 1B MDA alert panel collapse on cohort overflow** — caught during G8 live demo run, not by the G2 or G9 test suites. `minHeight: 0` on the flex container allowed CohortImpactSection to squeeze MDAAlertPanelZone1B to zero when cohort rows filled the natural height.
   - **G8 strict mode `getByText` collision** (NM-062) — Playwright step-axis `getByText` matched the projection panel's duplicate step text, producing a strict mode error. Caught during Step 6 screenshot capture.

2. *Process gaps that caused them:*
   - **Calibration gap** — no test verifies that a known-realistic conditionality shock (5% GDP fiscal cut on SEN T3 scenario) produces a cohort poverty headcount change of a defensible magnitude within an 8-step window. The test suite verifies that cohort entities exist and that the endpoint responds — not that the engine's output is analytically meaningful.
   - **Adaptive y-axis** — the pre-IR test suite had no assertion that verified visual distinguishability (minimum pixel separation between curves of similar value). The `computeYDomain()` unit tests were authored POST-detection (correct fix but test-after, not test-before).
   - **Zone 1B overflow** — no test verified that the MDA alert panel maintained minimum visible height when CohortImpactSection was populated with multiple rows.
   - **Demo script locator discipline** — Step 6 screenshot scripts relied on `getByText()` without scoping to a specific parent container, creating fragility when duplicate text appeared in projection panel step axes.

3. *Testing improvements required before M17 close:*
   - [ ] **Calibration integration test** — after Wave 1 exits, add a backend integration test that asserts: given a representative conditionality shock on a T3 scenario, the cohort poverty headcount delta per step is within the CM-certified ELASTICITY_REGISTRY range. This is the test that would have caught the FRAME-D gap in M16.
   - [ ] **Visual distinguishability assertion** — after `computeYDomain()` pattern is extended to other instruments (#1251), add Playwright assertions verifying that trajectory curves with value range < 0.10 still produce visually distinct rendered paths (bounding-box separation ≥ N pixels).
   - [ ] **Zone 1B overflow regression** — add Playwright assertion that `MDAAlertPanelZone1B` maintains minimum visible height (≥ 80px) when `CohortImpactSection` is populated with 4+ cohort rows.
   - [ ] **Demo script testid discipline** — all demo screenshot scripts must scope locators to named parent containers; `getByText()` without scoping is prohibited in demo scripts (NM-062 countermeasure).

**Issue:** #990 ✅ CLOSED 2026-06-23

| Check | Result | Key finding |
|---|---|---|
| VC-1 — Docker Compose startup + responsiveness | ✅ **PASS** | `/health/` HTTP 200; GRC/JOR/EGY/ZMB in `/countries`; frontend reachable; peak memory ~440 MiB / 7.663 GiB limit |
| VC-2 — Simulation engine 8-step timing | ✅ **PASS** | 0.079s wall-clock (target ≤ 60s); all 4 framework keys in trajectory |
| VC-3 — Non-Docker Playwright path documented | ✅ **CONDITIONAL PASS** | `CONTRIBUTING.md §4` lightweight local path documented; requires PostGIS DB via Docker; fully offline path (MSW) planned for future milestone; limitation on record |
| VC-4 — Frontend build time | ✅ **PASS** | 3.4 seconds on 10-core host (target ≤ 5 min); build exits 0 |

**Overall: 3 PASS + 1 CONDITIONAL PASS. No FAIL findings. No new issues filed.**

**Infrastructure Sprint declaration confirmed at exit:** No G6 output modifies user-visible application state. VC-3 CONDITIONAL PASS limitation is documentation-only (no implementation gap). PI Agent confirms Infrastructure Sprint Exception classification is correct for G6.

**G6 is CLOSED.** Issue #990 closed 2026-06-23. NM-056 filed for AC-4 soft-skip-masking-mock-bug pattern. CI fix: PR #1130 (null ?? 2 → !== undefined check); validation PR: #1128; sprint exit PR: #1131.

**CI note (PR #1128):** Pre-existing AC-4 test failure (`makeTrajectoryMock` null-tier bug, PR #1130) was blocking merge. Root cause: `null ?? 2` collapsed to 2; masked by backend startup failure before PR #1123 (Docker migrations). Fixed 1-line in test helper. PR #1130 merged to release/m15 first; PR #1128 rebased and merged 2026-06-23.

## EL Scope Decision — 2026-06-23 (G8 Deferral)

**Authority:** Engineering Lead scope decision. Recorded by PM Agent.

### G8 Deferral — #843 deferred from M15 to M16

The live stakeholder demo with real external participants (#843) is deferred from M15 to M16 per EL decision 2026-06-23.

**Rationale (EL):** M15 has delivered its full architectural mandate (G1–G7 complete). The demo is a delivery vehicle, not an architectural gate — deferring does not leave architectural debt in M15.

**Dispositions:**
- #843 moved to GitHub milestone #17 (M16 — Distributional Visibility); comment posted on issue
- #843 is now the M16 exit gate — M16 sprint plan must designate it as such at kickoff
- M15 exit gate is now the exit ceremony (#984): open issue audit → milestone reference audit → SESSION_STATE consistency check → fresh session continuity test
- Sprint plan amended: `docs/process/sprint-plans/m15-sprint-plan.md` (Amendment 2026-06-23)

**M15 status at this decision:** Scope-complete. All implementation work done. Exit ceremony is the only remaining M15 action.

**Constraint document:** `docs/architecture/constraints.md`

### AC-001 — Private Data Inputs Are Prohibited (Permanent)

Private, proprietary, or ministry-owned data inputs are architecturally prohibited. The shared public dataset guarantee is the epistemic foundation of WorldSim's negotiating authority — reproducibility by both parties requires both parties to be able to inspect the same public sources. Private inputs sever reproducibility.

**Founding document basis:** `docs/vision/worldsim-founding-document.md §Open Source as Strategy`

**Issue dispositions:**

| Issue | Title | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| #976 ✅ | Path 2 — ministry-owned / proprietary data upload | CLOSED 2026-06-21 — will-not-implement (AC-001); permanent prohibition, not a capacity deferral |
| #53 ✅ | RBAC design (prerequisite for Path 2) | CLOSED 2026-06-21 — will-not-implement (AC-001); prerequisite for Path 2 which is permanently closed |
| #5 ✅ | Data marketplace — curated / user-contributed datasets | CLOSED 2026-06-21 — will-not-implement-at-this-stage; no validated real-world demand; re-open trigger: real finance ministry analyst articulates specific dataset need Path 1 cannot satisfy |
| #4 ✅ | Advanced geocoded dataset integration | CLOSED 2026-06-21 — will-not-implement-at-this-stage; no validated real-world demand; same re-open trigger |

**G4 scope confirmed (post-AC-001):** G4 = #975 (Path 1 approved source network) + ADR-016 Component 3 only. #53 removed from G4 scope.

### AC-002 — Synthetic Substitution from Public Sources Is Permitted with Mandatory Indicator-Level Disclosure

Synthetic estimates from comparable economies, regional distributions, and historical patterns are permitted and required for the democratization mission. Three mandatory conditions: indicator-level disclosure, T3 confidence tier floor, meaninglessness threshold suppression. The sparse-data problem is addressed through ADR-007 and the confidence tier system — not through private uploads.

**Founding document basis:** `docs/vision/worldsim-founding-document.md §Open Source as Strategy`; `CLAUDE.md §Synthetic Data and the Data Inference Layer`

**Future scope:** Methodology audit of ADR-007 against data-sparse countries (Chad, Yemen, Myanmar) — filed as future scope item after ADR-007 is complete; not a new capability; validates the framework against real data-poverty conditions.

### Parking Lot Dispositions (2026-06-21)

| Issue | Title | Disposition |
|---|---|---|
| #35 | Dynamic relationship weight updating | Moved to Parking Lot milestone (GitHub milestone #20) — complexity addition; deferred until core capability is battle-tested through real-world use; no trigger condition required |
| #30 | Stock vs. flow variable distinction | Moved to Parking Lot milestone (GitHub milestone #20) — complexity addition; same deferral basis |

### Insights Log

Entry 7 added to `docs/insights-log.md` (2026-06-21): AC-001 and AC-002 should be reflected in the founding document as explicit permanent governing constraints — flag for EL to author addition to `docs/vision/worldsim-founding-document.md §Open Source as Strategy`.

### Hard Stop

**No G-group sprint entry may be filed or EL-approved until the constraint record PR is merged to `release/m15`.** The constraint record (AC-001, AC-002, issue dispositions) must be on the release branch before any further G-group sprint entries reference G4 scope or open issues.

**Next action:** M13 EXIT CEREMONY COMPLETE 2026-06-15. G8 sprint exit filed (`docs/process/sprint-plans/m13-g8-sprint-exit.md`). All M13 issues dispositioned (11 closed, 9 migrated to M14). Reference docs updated (README, CLAUDE.md, roadmap). NM-044 filed (E2E regression gap). Required EL action: merge `release/m13` → `main`, close #264, tag release, close GitHub Milestone 9. M14 kickoff is the next agent action.

### M14 Kickoff Prerequisites (RESOLVED 2026-06-15)

**✅ HARD STOP CLEARED:** EL merged `release/m13` → `main` 2026-06-15. All G1–G8 M13 deliverables are on `main`. M14 work may proceed.

| #987 — Political risk summary surface (Persona 3) | ✅ Filed (M15) | Plain-language legitimacy dynamics |
| #990 — Accessibility validation on target hardware | ✅ Filed (M15) | 8GB/4-core laptop gate |
| G8 sprint entry document | ✅ **EL APPROVED 2026-06-19** (PR #1054) | `docs/process/sprint-plans/m14-g8-sprint-entry.md`; ZMB only; no Mode 3; reserve challenge → Grounding strip citation; demo prep standard as governing intent doc; implementation unblocked |
| G8 Step 1 — demo issue filed | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 | #1055 filed (demo: M14 stakeholder demo preparation — v0.14.0 / Milestone 14) |
| G8 Step 2 — screenshot brief | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1056) | `docs/demo/m14/screenshot-brief.md`; five frames; thesis frame C (citation at table); ZMB; no Mode 3 |
| G8 Step 3 — `demo.sh` updated | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1056) | M14 Demo 5 ZMB/no-Mode3; challenge-response framing; honest disclosures; NM-041 `bash -n` gate PASS |
| G8 Step 4 — `demo-narrated.spec.ts` | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1056) | Rewritten for ZMB ECF; `demo-narrated-m12.spec.ts` archived; NM-039 sentinel; 1440×900 viewport |
| G8 Step 5 — walkthroughs | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1056) | `docs/demo/m14/stakeholder-walkthrough.md`; root redirect updated; narration checks 5a/5c encoded in walkthrough |
| G8 Step 5b — legibility gate | ✅ PASS 2026-06-19 | `demo-legibility.spec.ts` 10/10 pass at 1440×900 |
| G8 Step 5c — NARRATION-RULING-1 | ✅ PASS 2026-06-19 | All 5 presentation steps: Umbrella + Synthesis + Transition verified |
| G8 Step 6 — screenshot capture | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1058) | Five frames captured; Round 3 spec fixes (ecological disabled, democratic_quality_score=0.80 to reserve top alert slot); Reserve WARNING Current 2.908 / Floor 2.500 visible in Zone 1B detail slot |
| G8 Step 6b — internal nine-agent review | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19 (PR #1060) | `docs/demo/m14/reviews/2026-06-19-v0.14.0-internal-review.md`; 8 findings; 4 CRITICAL/HIGH blocking walkthrough errors corrected in same PR; Issue #1059 filed (HCL narration M15 scope) |
| G8 Step 7 — Independent Review | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-19/20 (PR #1064 + #1070) | `docs/demo/m14/reviews/2026-06-19-v0.14.0-ir-review.md`; 10 findings (IR-001–IR-010); five CRITICAL/HIGH issues filed (#1065–#1069); three-agent panel (UX Designer, Frontend Architect, Business PO) assessed IR-001 and IR-004 |
| G8 EL decision — IR issue triage | ✅ RECORDED 2026-06-20 | IR findings do not gate Demo 5. IR-004 Path B (narration correction) applied in M14. IR-001 (#1065), IR-002 (#1066), IR-003 (#1067), IR-004 Path A (#1068), IR-005 (#1069) deferred to M15 with implementation guidance comments. All five issues moved to M15 milestone / `horizon:near-term`. |
| G8 IR-004 Path B — Zone 1D narration | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-20 (PR #1071) | `stakeholder-walkthrough.md` corrected: Zone 1A badge claim → Zone 1D L0 annotation reference (4 locations). Zone 1D already implements correct L0 annotations; walkthrough narration now matches application state. |
| G8 Step 6c — audience simulation | ✅ **COMPLETE 2026-06-20** (PR #1076) | `docs/demo/m14/reviews/2026-06-20-v0.14.0-audience-simulation.md`; 25 findings DEMO-097–DEMO-121; 4 CRITICAL; north star verdict: FAIL/BLOCKED |
| G8 DEMO-099 — PSP Layer 3 sentence gap | ✅ Filed as #1075 (M15) | PSP shows value only; no self-interpreting sentence; political advisor (Andreas) cannot brief Minister from number alone; paired with #1065 (Zone 1B); walkthrough narration path available |
| G8 Step 6c escalations | ✅ RECORDED 2026-06-20 | #1065 updated: now CRITICAL across 3 personas, north star FAIL; #1069 updated: CRITICAL across 2 personas, north star FAIL; EL exception paths documented on both |
| G8 EL decision — north star FAIL acceptance | ✅ RECORDED 2026-06-20 | EL accepted FAIL verdict as honest evidence of M14 underdelivery against Layer 3 / PSP promise. Decision: retain all promises as explicit M15 roadmap items in narration rather than scrubbing or claiming delivery. More honest than a pass achieved by narrowing the claim. |
| G8 Honest narration revision | ✅ COMPLETE 2026-06-20 (PR #1078) | `stakeholder-walkthrough.md` revised: (1) Layer 3 sentence framed as M15 roadmap commitment throughout; (2) dual reserve values explicitly disambiguated in Frame C narration (3.8=initial entry-state, 2.9=current simulated step 3); (3) PSP 0.65 translated into plain language in Frame D narration; (4) DEMO-100 presenter timing note added (Section 1 must complete before Frame C displayed). |
| G8 North star re-evaluation | ✅ **PASS** (conditional) | Targeted re-evaluation: revised narration allows Aicha to state primary finding without specialist mediation — presenter explicitly narrates "CRITICAL is one step away" from on-screen data, and disambiguates dual reserve values before she can question them. Condition: revised narration delivered as written. North star gate: **UNBLOCKED**. |
| G8 Step 9 — simulated stakeholder session | ✅ **COMPLETE 2026-06-20 (PR #1081)** | Simulated session (EL decision: real external participants not yet available; #843 deferred to M15). Four-persona panel: Lucas P1, Eleni P2, Andreas P3, Aicha P5. North star: **PASS (conditional)** — Aicha stated argument: "The figure you are challenging is from your institution's own publication. Our initial conditions are derived from IMF WEO April 2024." 8 new findings DEMO-122–129 (all MEDIUM or LOW). Artifact: `docs/demo/m14/reviews/2026-06-20-v0.14.0-stakeholder-review.md`. |
| G8 new findings from Step 9 | ✅ DISPOSITIONED 2026-06-20 | DEMO-122 → #1083; DEMO-127 → #1084; DEMO-123 → #1088; DEMO-124 → #1089; DEMO-129 → #1090 (all M15 scope). DEMO-125/126/128 → confirmed M15 scope (companions to #1065, #1066, #1069). DEMO-123/124/129 slipped M14 close; filed as M15 issues at 2026-06-20 HORIZON sweep. |
| #843 live external demo | ⬜ **DEFERRED TO M15** (EL decision 2026-06-20) | M14 simulated session accepted as closure evidence; real external participants required in M15. |

**Phase C complete:** `docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseC-exit.md` — **EL endorsed 2026-06-12 (PR #904). Phase D COMPLETE.**

**Phase D complete:** `docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseD-exit.md` — **EL endorsed 2026-06-12 (PR #906). Process Redesign Sequence (Phases 0–D) CLOSED.**

**Gaps closed by Phase A:**

| Gap | Closed by | Location |
|---|---|---|
| Execution lifecycle gap — no gate between "ADR accepted" and "PR merged" | Five-step lifecycle with enforcement gates | `CLAUDE.md §Agent Execution Lifecycle` |
| Rejection artifact gap — Verify failure had no mandatory consequence | Rejection artifact spec with sprint exit block + near-miss obligation | `CLAUDE.md §Agent Execution Lifecycle — When Verify or Validate fails` |
| **FD-2** — Layer 3 self-interpreting output has no process owner | Customer Agent Layer 3 gate at Validate step | `CLAUDE.md §Agent Execution Lifecycle — Layer 3 Quality Gate` |
| **FD-3** — Kryptonite frame never governs tradeoffs | Kryptonite design constraint at Intent authorship + Validate | `CLAUDE.md §Agent Execution Lifecycle — Kryptonite Design Constraint` |
| Intent document format gap — no standard for Implementation Intent | Canonical template with observable application state + Kryptonite check | `docs/process/intent-template.md` |

## Process Redesign Sprint — Phase B Status

| 4 — EL endorsement | EL | `docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseB-exit.md §Part VII` | #902 | ✅ Endorsed 2026-06-12 |

**What Phase B produced:**
- **`docs/process/acceptance-protocol.md`** — per-type verification checklists (frontend, backend, docs, analytics); DEMO4 class check explicit in backend protocol; asymmetry test operationalizes FD-3 at Validate step; Customer Agent Layer 3 as precondition (not follow-up); rejection artifact triggers + format + re-acceptance process + EL exception path; PI enforcement review embedded
- **`docs/process/agents.md` amendment** — `PO: ACCEPT` activation mode with canonical protocol reference
- **`docs/process/sprint-planning-sop.md` amendment** — §Sprint Exit Gate: exit conditions, agent responsibilities at exit, what "CI green" does not substitute for, sprint exit artifact format

## Process Redesign Sprint — Phase C Status

**Phase C: Sprint Cadence Formalization**
**Status:** COMPLETE — EL endorsement recorded 2026-06-12 (PR #904). Phase D COMPLETE.

| Step | Agent | Output | PR | Status |

- **`docs/process/sprint-plans/templates/sprint-exit-template.md`** — per-deliverable Business PO acceptance table; Layer 3 sequencing check (before verdict); PI Agent confirmation as Section 5 named gate
- **`docs/process/agents.md` PM Agent amendment** — `§Sprint Boundary Obligations`: sprint entry/exit obligations; EL-approved definition; infrastructure sprint declaration scope
- **`docs/process/agents.md` PI Agent amendment** — `§Sprint Boundary Enforcement`: unconditional near-miss obligation when sprint opens without entry doc; exit gate confirmation role; what PI Agent does and does not do
- **`docs/process/sprint-planning-sop.md` amendment** — `§Sprint Entry Gate`: five entry conditions mirroring exit gate; who confirms; infrastructure exception; entry artifact reference; §Sprint Exit Artifact updated to reference filed document over issue comment

## Process Redesign Sprint — Phase D Status

**Phase D: Session Boundary Discipline**
**Status:** COMPLETE — EL endorsement recorded 2026-06-12 (PR #906). Process Redesign Sequence (Phases 0–D) CLOSED.

| Step | Agent | Output | PR | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity amendment — §Entry and Exit Invariants | PI Agent | `CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity — §Entry and Exit Invariants` | #906 | ✅ Merged 2026-06-12 |
| 2 — PM Agent enforceability review | PM Agent | `docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseD-exit.md §Part III` | #906 | ✅ Merged 2026-06-12 |

| 4 — EL endorsement | EL | `docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseD-exit.md §Part VIII` | #906 | ✅ Endorsed 2026-06-12 |

**What Phase D produced:**
- **`CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity — §Entry and Exit Invariants`** — sprint entry hard stop (PM Agent may not authorize implementation without filed, EL-approved entry document); sprint exit hard stop (CI green + issue closure not sufficient; four named conditions required); "if it isn't written down, it doesn't exist" principle
- **`docs/process/sprint-plans/process-redesign-phaseD-exit.md`** — Phase D exit artifact with PM Agent enforceability review (Part III); PM Agent verdict: language creates genuine obligations; single-principal circularity is real but bounded (not a drafting gap); sequence closure summary (Part VII)

**Gaps closed by Phase D:**

| Gap | Closed by | Location |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md constitutional gap — sprint entry/exit gates not in primary session reading | §Entry and Exit Invariants in §Session Continuity | `CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity` |
| Agent session start had no sprint boundary obligation visible | Constitutional hard stop visible at every session start | `CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity — §Entry and Exit Invariants` |
| "If it isn't written down" had no operational form | Artifact-as-proof principle: session memory ≠ gate satisfaction | `CLAUDE.md §Session Continuity — §Entry and Exit Invariants` |

**Process Redesign Sequence — all four mechanisms operational:**

| Phase | Mechanism | Primary output | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | UX/persona → ADR traceability | ADR template; persona trace; north star process gate | ✅ Complete |
| Phase A | Agent execution lifecycle | Five-step lifecycle; rejection artifact spec; Layer 3 gate; Kryptonite constraint | ✅ Complete |
| Phase B | Business PO acceptance protocol | `acceptance-protocol.md`; ACCEPT mode in agents.md; Sprint Exit Gate in SOP | ✅ Complete |
| Phase C | Sprint cadence formalization | Sprint entry/exit templates; PM + PI role amendments; Sprint Entry Gate in SOP | ✅ Complete |
| Phase D | Session boundary discipline | CLAUDE.md §Entry and Exit Invariants | ✅ Complete |

**Gaps closed:**

| Gap | Closed by | Location |
|---|---|---|
| XD-2 — Mission-to-implementation traceability never required | ADR template (Step 4) | `docs/adr/template.md` |
| XD-1 — Minister vs. specialist persona conflict unresolved | Persona conflict resolution ruling (Step 3) | `docs/ux/personas.md §Section 7` |

- ~~Step 6c gate~~ — **PASS (2026-06-11)**: PR #880 resolved DEMO-070/071/081/090; DEMO-080 accepted as-is by EL (tablet scale, out of scope for 1440×900 live demo). Audience simulation review updated. Step 9 unblocked.
- ~~Step 9 simulated session~~ — **COMPLETE (2026-06-11)**. North star verdict: PASS. Aicha: "The conditionality dispute is about who absorbs the employment cost — the reserve crisis happens either way. That argument is now quantified." Artifact: `docs/demo/m12/reviews/2026-06-11-v0.12.1-stakeholder-review.md` (PR #886). Screenshots recaptured with PR #880 UI changes (PR #883). Two new M13 issues: #884 (reserve value not on screen), #885 (Exploratory tier on baseline vs. projection). Per-entity curves (#845) confirmed as primary unresolved UX gap.
- ~~#843 M12 live external demo~~ — **DEFERRED TO M14** (EL decision 2026-06-11). Issue repurposed as M14 closure gate: live stakeholder demo with real external participants, timed to coincide with methodology publication. M12 simulated session (north star PASS) stands as M12 closure evidence. M12 is now formally complete pending only the exit checklist (#263).
- ~~#852~~ — **DEFERRED TO M13** (EL decision 2026-06-11): alert panel master-detail UX requires Frontend architecture review, ADR, UX Designer + Design Thinking agent input.

## Closed — M11.5 (Usability Validation and Experience Audit)

**Formally closed: 2026-06-04** | **North Star:** `docs/vision/milestone-11-5-north-star.md` | **GitHub Milestone:** 14 (closed)

| Issue | Title | Gate |
|---|---|---|

**M11.5 Session Status:**

| Session ID | Persona | Valid | Verdict | PR |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-04-persona-2-001 | Persona 2 (infra validation) | NO — cold-start violated | Infrastructure validated; Pillar 1 functional | #732 ✅ |
| 2026-06-04-persona-2-002 | Persona 2 — Finance Ministry Negotiator | NO — reclassified as developer audit | Agent used API spec + curl instead of navigating UI. Findings are real technical gaps, not usability findings. Superseded by 003. | #733 ✅ |
| 2026-06-04-persona-2-003 | Persona 2 — Finance Ministry Negotiator | **YES** — genuine cold-start, visual navigation | PARTIALLY MET — agent reached [CONCLUDED:] but ~80% from historical knowledge, ~20% from tool output. Alert panel non-interactive; no cohort data visible. | #736 ✅ |
| 2026-06-04-persona-1-001 | Persona 1 — Programme Analyst (Lucas Ferreira) | **YES** — genuine cold-start, visual navigation | NOT MET — fiscal multiplier parameter absent; alert non-interactive; no disaggregated indicators; 5 actions, 0 visible responses. | #738 ✅ |
| 2026-06-04-persona-5-001 | Persona 5 — Institutional Decision-Maker (Executive Director, IMF) | **YES** — genuine cold-start, visual navigation | PARTIALLY MET — reframed task from tradeoff to joint design failure; reached [CONCLUDED:] in 3 turns. Scenario identity unconfirmed (CRITICAL GAP); financial trajectory possibly incomplete; composite scores uninterpretable. | #739 ✅ |

**Findings from Session 3 (2026-06-04-persona-2-003) — UI usability findings:**

| Finding | Severity | Dimension | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FINDING-01 | CRITICAL | Action | TERMINAL alert panel non-interactive — 3 click attempts, zero navigation response or expansion |
| FINDING-02 | HIGH | Comprehension | Alert text + trajectory chart illegible at 1440×900 — 3-turn disambiguation delay on alert type |
| FINDING-03 | HIGH | Discovery | No cohort disaggregation visible — CONCLUDED answer was ~80% historical knowledge, not tool output |
| FINDING-04 | MEDIUM | Discovery | Greece not highlighted on map despite scenario loaded — 3-turn scenario-active uncertainty |
| FINDING-05 | MEDIUM | Comprehension | "Primary dimension — see alerts" misdirects to non-interactive display panel |

**Findings from Session P1-001 (2026-06-04-persona-1-001) — UI usability findings:**

| Finding | Severity | Dimension | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FINDING-01 | CRITICAL | Action | Fiscal multiplier parameter absent — no UI path to configure or compare 0.5 vs 1.5 multiplier |
| FINDING-02 | CRITICAL | Action | Alert panel non-interactive — replication of S003-FINDING-01; confirmed persona-independent |
| FINDING-03 | HIGH | Discovery | Poverty headcount and health system capacity not surfaced as named indicators anywhere |
| FINDING-04 | HIGH | Comprehension | Active scenario not identifiable — scenario/task mismatch risk; never resolved in 5 turns |
| FINDING-05 | MEDIUM | Action | Zone-1a and zone-1d both show composites only; no sub-indicator drill-in |

**Findings from Session P5-001 (2026-06-04-persona-5-001) — UI usability findings:**

| Finding | Severity | Dimension | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FINDING-01 | HIGH | Comprehension | Financial trajectory completeness — agent concluded "no recovery" but Greece historically achieved primary surplus 2014; links to Issue #221 |
| FINDING-02 | CRITICAL | Discovery | Active scenario identification — named "CRITICAL GAP" before concluding; severity escalation confirmed across all 3 Priority A sessions |
| FINDING-03 | MEDIUM | Comprehension | Composite score interpretability — Financial ~0.58, Human Development ~2.73 uninterpretable without scale, baseline, or direction indicator |

**Findings from Session 2 (2026-06-04-persona-2-002) — backend technical findings (developer audit):**

| Finding | Severity | Dimension | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| FINDING-01 | CRITICAL | Action | Human development indicators frozen at 2010 initial values — human cost ledger produces no output |
| FINDING-02 | CRITICAL | Discovery | No cohort disaggregation — minimum wage workers, pensioners, youth invisible to measurement framework |
| FINDING-03 | HIGH | Comprehension | Composite score discrepancy: /trajectory returns scores; /measurement-output says "not meaningful" |
| FINDING-04 | HIGH | Action | Conditionality instruments too coarse — wage cut, pensions, privatisation all folded into spending_change |
| FINDING-05 | MEDIUM | Discovery | Counter-scenario creation not discoverable without developer knowledge of POST schema |
| FINDING-06 | MEDIUM | Comprehension | `indicator_name` null in MDA alert API response |

**Exit criterion status — all three Priority A sessions complete:**

| Session | Persona | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-04-persona-2-003 | Finance Ministry Negotiator | PARTIALLY MET — ~80% historical knowledge, ~20% tool output |
| 2026-06-04-persona-1-001 | Programme Analyst | NOT MET — fiscal multiplier parameter absent; 0 visible UI responses |
| 2026-06-04-persona-5-001 | Institutional Decision-Maker | PARTIALLY MET — concluded in 3 turns; scenario identity and trajectory completeness unconfirmed |

**Cross-session pattern — the one finding present across ALL three Priority A sessions:** Active scenario cannot be confirmed from the main viewport. Severity: MEDIUM (P2) → HIGH (P1) → CRITICAL (P5). This is the minimum fix required before any Priority A use case can be considered served.

**Session runners:**
- `scripts/run_usability_session_interactive.py` — Interactive Playwright loop (Option 2, default). Start with: `python3 scripts/run_usability_session_interactive.py <session_id> <persona_id> [--scenario <uuid>]`. No API key required. Coordinator reads screenshots via Read tool and writes actions to IPC files.
- `scripts/run_usability_session.py` — Computer-use runner (Option 1). Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Separate Anthropic API billing.

**Priority A sessions:** COMPLETE (P2 S003 ✅, P1-001 ✅, P5-001 ✅). Priority B sessions (P6 Civic Researcher, P8 Community Leader) are next if EL authorises.

**M12 action items from all sessions:**
- Make TERMINAL alert panel interactive — click expands to indicator time-series + threshold progression + driver attribution (S003-FINDING-01)
- Increase alert text font size; add human-readable indicator label alongside technical key (S003-FINDING-02 + S002-FINDING-06)
- Cohort disaggregation visible in main view: youth unemployment, pensioner poverty, bottom-quintile income share (S003-FINDING-03 + S002-FINDING-02)
- Highlight active scenario country on map; show active scenario name in persistent header (S003-FINDING-04)
- Human development module must respond to fiscal policy inputs — unemployment elasticity, health expenditure linkage (S002-FINDING-01)
- Named conditionality instruments: minimum_wage_change_pct, pension_replacement_rate_change_pct, etc. (S002-FINDING-04)
- "Duplicate and modify" action on scenario cards for counter-scenario creation (S002-FINDING-05)
- Remove or caveat composite scores in single-entity scenario trajectory view (S002-FINDING-03)
- Fiscal multiplier parameter input in scenario configuration — 0.5 vs 1.5 comparison (P1-FINDING-01)
- Side-by-side or overlaid scenario comparison for parameter sensitivity analysis (P1-FINDING-01)
- Poverty headcount and health system capacity as named, disaggregated output indicators (P1-FINDING-03)
- Active scenario name + country in persistent main viewport header (P1-FINDING-04, P5-FINDING-02, S003-FINDING-04) — this is the cross-session universal finding
- Financial trajectory must show full arc including partial recovery; incomplete trajectories must be labelled (P5-FINDING-01; links to Issue #221 mean-reversion channel)
- Each composite score in zone-1d must show: current value, direction indicator (↑↓), scale tooltip; plain-language label for non-economist users (P5-FINDING-03)

**M11 formally closed:** Issue #262 closed 2026-06-04, GitHub Milestone 12 (M11) closed, tagged `v0.11.0`.

## Open Issues — M10 Horizon:Immediate (active)

| Issue | Title | Status / Gate |
|---|---|---|
| #550 ✅ | test(e2e): MV-002 hardware render baseline — TrajectoryView ≤ 100ms on ProBook | **Closed 2026-06-01** — AC-007 ✅ PASSED ≤ 100ms (4× throttle active), AC-008 ✅ PASSED ≤ 100ms (4× throttle active). Machine: HP ProBook i5-8265U, 8 GiB RAM, 4 cores, Windows 11. PR #578. |
| #495 ✅ | feat(frontend): wire mda_alerts into MDA Alert Panel — Zone 1B live data (IR-001 Critical) | **Closed** — measurement-output fetch wired in ScenarioInstrumentCluster.tsx; store.setMdaAlerts() called after each step advance. |
| #496 ✅ | feat(api): PMM live computation backend endpoint (IR-002) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #587 merged. Per-step PMM embedded in trajectory response; frontend syncs to store on step change. |
| #497 ✅ | feat(frontend): persistent scenario state + demonstrative entry — localStorage + URL param (IR-003) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #584 merged. localStorage `worldsim_last_scenario` key; URL `?scenario=` param takes precedence. |
| #498 ✅ | feat(frontend): default step labels from start year (IR-004) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #583 merged. Start year input in create form; `start_date` passed to backend. |
| #499 ✅ | fix(frontend): remove governance "(in validation)" annotation (IR-005) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #585 merged as part of Issue #556 (governance promotion). |
| #500 ✅ | feat(frontend): Zone 1D loading state skeleton (IR-006) | **Closed** (prior session) — PR #582 merged. |
| #553 ✅ | feat(fixture): Argentina 2000–2002 second country fixture — IMF debt crisis (Demo 3) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #590 merged. `build_argentina_demo_scenario()`: n_steps=4, EcologicalModule + GovernanceModule, NOAA MLO 2000 CO2 seed, WGI/V-Dem ARG 2000 governance seeds, step_metadata event labels (steps 1–3 SIGNIFICANT). `step_metadata` added to `ScenarioConfigSchema` (was being stripped by Pydantic on POST). Demo script at `backend/scripts/demo_argentina_2001_2002.py`. |
| #556 ✅ | feat(governance): GovernanceModule M10 promotion — ADR-005 Amendment 4 | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #585 merged. All five criteria met. |
| #675 | fix(demo): demo-narrated.spec.ts captures at 1280×720 — mismatches legibility gate (1440×900) and live demo viewport | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Three required fixes: (1) `page.setViewportSize({ width: 1440, height: 900 })` in demo spec; (2) update `SCREENSHOT_DIR` to `m{N}/screenshots/` each milestone; (3) update demo-preparation-standard Steps 4 and 6 with explicit viewport requirement. Root cause of DEMO-020. NM-032. |
| #674 | fix(frontend): DEMO-020 — Zone 1A y-axis tick labels clipped at left component boundary | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. `margin.left` on `ComposedChart` too narrow for 6-char labels when ecological score >1.0. Fix: increase to 48–56px or format ticks to 4-char precision. Confirm with `demo-legibility.spec.ts` at 1440×900. |
| #673 | demo: DEMO-019 — PMM None state ("—") has no explanation for non-specialist users | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. UX copy change in `PMMWidgetZone1C.tsx`: conditional sub-label when `pmm_value` is null. "All thresholds breached — see alerts" or equivalent. Distinct from DEMO-016 (nonzero PMM precision). |
| #672 | demo: DEMO-018 — Zone 1A legend shows raw variable names for CI upper bound and active curves | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Pass `legendType="none"` on CI/ghost `<Line>` components or add explicit `name` prop. `getIndicatorDisplayNameAny()` fix (#617) covered AttributeSelector, not Recharts legend derived keys. |
| #667 | demo: DEMO-010 — M10 screenshots unverified as post-fix state | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Verify whether `docs/demo/m10/screenshots/` files are pre- or post-DEMO-003/005 fix. Attestation required in SEQUENCE.md. |
| #668 | demo: DEMO-011 — Frame D not re-captured after DEMO-005 fix | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Frame D Zone 1A legend overlap fix (PR #345) may not be reflected in repository artifact. Re-capture or attestation required. |
| #669 | demo: DEMO-013 — dashed curve convention not narrated in M10 walkthrough | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Screenshot brief §Key Narration Notes #2 requirement unimplemented. Add dashed=projected/solid=historical sentence to Section 2 Step 2. Walkthrough doc only — no implementation required. |
| #670 | demo: DEMO-017 — Human Development composite trajectory absent from M10 walkthrough narration | **Filed 2026-06-03** — Milestone M11, horizon:near-term. Human cost arc not narrated in Section 2. Must name at least one capability domain and one affected cohort class. Step 5c NARRATION-RULING-1 self-check required after update. |
| #569 | test(e2e): AC-009 re-run — Mode 3 advance-step → render ≤ 100ms (hardware baseline) | Deferred M12 — Mode 3 not yet built. Blocked by Mode 3 implementation. |
| #22 | feat(engine): confidence_tier split — per-indicator separate from composite | **Deferred to M11 (2026-06-03)** — Required by ADR-007 (`is_synthetic`, `synthetic_method` Quantity fields) but ADR-007 framework is not implemented in M10. Rationale comment posted on issue. |
| #27 | feat(engine): Monte Carlo distribution output — replaces point estimates with scenario bands | **Deferred to M11 (2026-06-03)** — Foundational to ADR-007 No False Precision principle (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic bands). Cannot be scoped before ADR-009 (engine computation model) is accepted; ADR-009 is M11 work. Rationale comment posted on issue. |
| #43 | feat(engine): backtesting validation harness — model vs. historical divergence scoring | **Deferred to M11 (2026-06-03)** — No Phase 1 baseline benchmarks consumed yet (delivered in M10 but not yet integrated into a validation harness); blocked by sparse matrix proof-of-concept (M11 core deliverable). Rationale comment posted on issue. |
| #45 | feat(engine): engine fidelity dashboard — model vs. actuals gap visualization | **Deferred to M11 (2026-06-03)** — Downstream of #43 (backtesting harness). Cannot ship a gap visualization before the harness that computes the gaps exists. Rationale comment posted on issue. |
| #575 ✅ | docs(ux): public advocacy personas — Investigative Journalist, Parliamentary Economist, Civil Society Monitor, Persona 4V | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #592 merged. Panel: PO Agent (R), UX Designer (C), Development Economist (C), Political Economist (C), Customer Agent (C). Four additions: Persona 6 (Farida Haidari, journalist, Dawn/Pakistan), Persona 7 (James Ochieng, Kenya PBO), Persona 8 (Abena Osei, SEND Ghana), Persona 4V (Dr. Priya Krishnaswamy, CDS/JNU). Primary Cases 6 (Pakistan flood + IMF combined shock), 7 (Kenya committee brief), 8 (Ghana accountability gap), Persona 4V marquee case (The Wardha Divergence). Retrospective entry state extended to cover accountability tracking sub-mode (no 7th state). Customer Agent finding: integrated observed-actuals input (Persona 8 accountability use case) is not a current platform capability — flagged in Persona 8 failure mode and Primary Case 8 exit criteria; roadmap item. |
| #574 | Epic: Vision-to-Architecture Bridge — personas → user experiences → technical concepts | **Filed 2026-06-01** — Three child issues: #575 ✅ (personas extension, closed PR #592), #576 ✅ (user experiences for second ring, closed PR #594), #577 (Phase 3 DIC technical concept review — unblocked). No active horizon assignment — EL to prioritize M10 or M11. |
| #577 | docs(ux): Phase 3 DIC technical concept review — [Phase-3-TBD] stories from Issue #576 | **ARCH-REVIEW-006 complete (PR #601, 2026-06-02). 11 child issues filed #603–#614 (2026-06-02).** 16 blindspots classified: 1 Immediate, 12 Near-Term, 3 Long-Term. One Immediate blocker: CM must author vocabulary mapping standard (#603, AR-006-B-007) before any US-043 implementation begins. Full findings: `docs/architecture/reviews/ARCH-REVIEW-006-milestone10.md`. Tracking comment posted on #577. |
| #615 ✅ | fix(fixture): Argentina Demo 3 — verify MDA alerts fire at step 2+; adjust governance seed if floor does not breach | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #624 merged. `emergency_declaration` added at step 2 (state of siege, December 19 2001 — concurrent with sovereign default). GovernanceModule one-step lag: processed at step 3, reducing `democratic_quality_score` by 0.05 (Bermeo 2016 elasticity). Score path: 0.71 → 0.715 (step 2, imf effect) → **0.665** (step 3) ≤ 0.70 floor → MDA WARNING fires at step 3. Three new regression tests including `test_build_argentina_demo_scenario_governance_mda_breach_math` (elasticity arithmetic gate). Wrong comment about base scheduled_inputs also corrected. |
| #616 ✅ | fix(frontend): Zone 1D ecological boundary annotation — "(1.0 = boundary)" sub-label or tooltip | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #622 merged. `"1.0 = boundary"` sub-label (9px, muted) added below "Ecological" row label in `FourFrameworkZone1D.tsx`. Ecological row only. `data-testid="ecological-boundary-note"` for future E2E assertion. |
| #617 ✅ | fix(frontend): AttributeSelector display names — add getIndicatorDisplayNameAny(), wire into AttributeSelector.tsx | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #622 merged. `getIndicatorDisplayNameAny(key)` added to `indicatorDisplayNames.ts` (iterates all framework blocks, title-case fallback). Wired into `AttributeSelector.tsx` — dropdown now shows "GDP Growth (%, FLOW)" instead of "gdp_growth (%, FLOW)". |
| #376 ✅ | test(e2e): Playwright demo advancement flow test — scenario advance, choropleth change, MDA accumulation, radar legibility | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #626 merged. `demo-advancement-flow.spec.ts`: 5 tests at 1440×900 — all four Zone 1 instruments live at every step; `choropleth-map` `data-step` attribute increments 0→1→2→3 (DEMO-001 guard); Zone 1B MDA panel live/non-blank at every step (DEMO-004 guard); Zone 1D framework scores non-empty at final step; advance button disabled exactly at step 3 (no overshoot). `ChoroplethMap.tsx`: `data-testid="choropleth-map"` + `data-step={currentStep ?? 0}` added to outer container. |
| #377 ✅ | test(e2e): legibility assertions — minimum font size, non-truncation, visibility for all demo components | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #626 merged. `demo-legibility.spec.ts`: 6 tests at 1440×900 — Zone 1 instrument bounding boxes non-zero (DEMO-002/003/005/006 guard); Zone 1C PMM value rendered ≥ 20px; Zone 1D framework labels ≥ 10px and not overflow-clipped; `ecological-boundary-note` visible with "1.0 = boundary" text (#616 regression guard); null composite rows carry dashed left border, live rows carry solid border (DEMO-006 guard); Zone 1B MDA text not overflow-clipped (DEMO-003 guard). |
| #342 ✅ | demo(choropleth): single-entity scenario shows no visible change across steps (DEMO-001) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — UX-RULING-4 (binding). FA Agent proposed HUD overlay on choropleth and Zone 1D attribute row; both declined. Root cause reframed: choropleth is a geographic context surface, not a change instrument. M10 fix: narration update (child #628, closed PR #629). M11 fix: Option B scenario-relative color scale (cross-step range endpoint required). |
| #343 ✅ | demo(radar): thesis frame asymmetry not independently legible without narration (DEMO-002) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — Substantially resolved by M9/M10 instrument cluster redesign. Narrow-drawer root cause no longer exists; Zone 1A is primary viewport instrument. M10 IR review: "substantially resolved." |
| #346 ✅ | demo(radar): axis labels and scores not legible at drawer scale (DEMO-005) | **Closed 2026-06-02** — Resolved by M9/M10 instrument cluster redesign. Zone 1D covers multi-framework readout in primary viewport; font sizes validated by `demo-legibility.spec.ts`. M10 IR review: "Significant→Minor." |
| #379 ✅ | process: demo preparation standard as pre-condition — standard must exist and be read before demo assembly begins | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #629 merged. `demo-preparation-standard.md`: Step 5a (narration instrument check, UX-RULING-4), Step 5b (legibility Playwright gate), Step 6 amendment (screenshot naming in presentation order). Carried forward from M9. |
| #628 ✅ | demo(script): update Demo 3 narration — route quantitative change to Zone 1A, not choropleth | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #629 merged. Child of #342, spawned from UX-RULING-4. `demo_argentina_2001_2002.py`: presenter instruction block in `_print_divergence_narrative` routes narrator to Zone 1A, not choropleth. |
| #537 ✅ | process: docs/demo/ file ownership — PM Agent must be R on demo preparation sequence | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #631 merged. `docs/demo/` row added to `docs/process/agent-raci.md` File Ownership table. PM Agent is R; Customer Agent and UX Designer are C. Demo preparation is a blocking exit requirement per milestone. |
| #535 ✅ | MILESTONE_RUNBOOK.md: update milestone definition table to reflect M9 exit | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. Table expanded from M0–M4 (M1 marked "In Progress") to M0–M13 with current status. M0–M9 Complete, M10 Current, M11–M13 Upcoming. |
| #536 ✅ | CONTRIBUTING.md: fix stale 'branch from develop' instruction | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. All four "branch from develop" occurrences replaced with "branch from main". |
| #538 ✅ | Document 'significant feature' threshold for ADR requirement | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. Explicit ADR threshold criteria table added to `CODING_STANDARDS.md §ADR Requirements`: 8 rows covering new module/API/methodology (new ADR), interface changes (amendment), bug/visual/docs (no ADR). PM + Architect jointly own ambiguous calls. |
| #539 ✅ | Add Customer Agent as 13th standing consultation obligation for UX-facing ADRs | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. Architect → Customer Agent obligation added to `agent-raci.md §Standing Consultation Obligations`. Customer Agent added to UX-design ADR minimum panel (C — Layer 3 usability finding). |
| #541 ✅ | PR template: require cross-ADR impact enumeration as a required field | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. "ADRs Affected" section added to `CONTRIBUTING.md` PR template (step 8) and Pre-PR Checklist (§3) with table template. |
| #543 ✅ | ADR-006 Decision 12: evaluate CI-enforcement path for Playwright phases 3–4 | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. Playwright phases 3–4 attestation added to `CONTRIBUTING.md` Pre-PR Checklist §5 for instrument-cluster frontend PRs. Mode transition safety (Phase 3) and render budget (Phase 4) attestation text required in PR description. CI enforcement evaluation deferred to M11. |
| #395 ✅ | data: step_event_label mandatory field — Mode 1 fixtures without event labels are incomplete | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. `DATA_STANDARDS.md §Scenario Fixture Step Annotation` added: step_metadata JSONB contract, significance enum (ROUTINE/SIGNIFICANT/CRITICAL), label constraints (≤8 words AND ≤32 chars), mandatory coverage rule. Greece fixture `build_greece_scenario()` updated with step_metadata for all 6 steps — all SIGNIFICANT, step 6 CRITICAL. Argentina fixture already compliant. |
| #512 ✅ | fix(fidelity): stale 'Deferred to M7' labels in backtesting dashboard | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #635 merged. `FidelityDashboard.tsx`: "Deferred to M7" → "M11" in both gap card notes (GRC #221, ARG #222), both milestone fields, and ADR-006 trigger line footer. Issues #221/#222 are open on M11; no work was delivered in M7/M8/M9. |
| #620 ✅ | docs(ux): UX/UI standards document — consolidated settled decisions with authority citations | **Closed 2026-06-02** — PR #631 merged. `docs/ux/standards.md` created with 15 sections: Framework Color Contract, Color Semantic Contract, Zone 1 Always-Visible Constraint, Zone Layout Dimensions, Choropleth Role (UX-RULING-4), Zone 1D Content Constraint (UX-RULING-4), Null vs. Zero Rendering, MDA Alert Sort Order, Mode-Specific Alert Tense (UX-RULING-1), Mode Indicator Labels (UX-RULING-3), Confidence Tier Visual, Zustand Atomic Update Contract, Loading/Error State Patterns, Step Annotation Rule, Automatic A/B Split (Mode 3). EL sign-off required for any amendment. |

## Pending Engineering Lead Decisions

| Decision | Context | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Demo 3 financial narration gap — "financial arc recovered" vs. 0.0000 composite | Step 4 narration replaced (PR #645). New wording directs audience to indicator panel for GDP +9%, acknowledges Kirchner recovery is real, notes governance composite healing slowly, and is explicit that the full recovery arc is M11 scope. "Financial arc has recovered" removed. | **RESOLVED ✅ 2026-06-02** |
| #221 mean-reversion channel — M10 or M11? | Option B selected 2026-05-30: M11 deferral confirmed. Greece MAGNITUDE fidelity gap at stabilisation cases acknowledged. Demo 3 proceeds without mean-reversion channel. Roadmap updated (hard-constraint language removed; rationale recorded). Decision posted on #261 and #221. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-30 |
|---|---|---|
| Trajectory endpoint implementation | FastAPI route + Pydantic model + normalized_absolute_strategy backend function. All prerequisites complete. May begin. | Ready — unblocked |
| US-GAP-001 — Andreas Mode 1 comparative case surface | **Resolved.** EL decision 2026-05-23: M10 gap. Issue #451 filed. information-hierarchy.md §COMPARE_VIEW Mode 1 placeholder added. user-stories file updated to reflect partial M9 service for Persona 3. | Complete ✅ — PR #452 |
| UX-RULING US-016 — alert text strings per mode | **Resolved.** Mode 1: `"crossed"` present; `"is projected"` + `"Caused by:"` absent. Mode 2: `"is projected to cross"`. Mode 3: ` — ` separator; starts with `"CRITICAL"` or `"WARNING"`. PR #454. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-23 |
| UX-RULING US-022 — null vs. zero CSS class | **Resolved.** Null → `score-value--null` (opacity ≤ 60%). Numeric/zero → `score-value--numeric`. PR #454. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-23 |
| UX-RULING US-026 — mode indicator label strings | **Resolved.** Mode 1: `"Replay"`. Mode 2: `"Simulation"`. Mode 3: `"Active Control"`. PR #454. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-23 |
|---|---|---|
| Decision A (DA-F2): MDA floor overlays deferred to M10 | M9 trajectory view ships without MDA floor ReferenceLines except ecological WARNING at y=1.0 (boundary-crossing, defensible without backtesting). CM consultation on indicator inventory + reference ranges authorized as M10 prerequisite. M10-B schema confirmed (new mda_composite_floors table with cm_approval_reference column). ADR-010 Decision 6 amendment pending. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-22 |
| Decision B (DA-F4): Path A selected — normalized absolute composite for single-entity trajectory | Path A: four framework curves rendered for single-entity scenarios; financial/HD use normalized absolute value composite (Tier 3 floor); strokeDasharray="8 3"; "single-country index" legend + tooltip; Zone 3 methodology note mandatory. CM reference range consultation is the hard implementation gate. ADR-010 Decision 2 amendment + Issue #193 update required. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-22 |
| Decision C (DA-F5): step_metadata JSONB option (a) confirmed | step_metadata key in scenarios.configuration JSONB; no migration; 1-based step index keys; SIGNIFICANT or ROUTINE values (never STANDARD). ADR-010 Decision 2 minor amendment pending. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-22 |
|---|---|---|
| ADR-010 acceptance | All 4 INCORPORATE items approved with rationale: FA-R3 (dense array contract — one null meaning only); FA-R4+UD-R1 (provisional hex values, UX Designer authority, RACI boundary correct); CM-R1 (No False Precision — deferral placeholder required); CM-R3 (composite-score floors only — indicator projection is methodologically dishonest). ADR-010 status → Accepted. ARCH-004 → ACCEPTED in backlog. M9 FA brief unblocked. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-22 |
| ADR-008 acceptance | All 6 INCORPORATE items applied; EL decision recorded (Option A: stacked forms, ~280px); ADR-008 status → Accepted; ARCH-002 → ACCEPTED in backlog. Issue #397 closed. FA brief (FA-C1–FA-C5) deferred to M9. | Complete ✅ — 2026-05-22 |
| GovernanceModule promotion path | Deferred from M8 demo — five criteria not yet met — target M9 | Decided: deferred |
| M8 formal close / M9 kickoff | Issue #370 filed — gate: retrospective + compliance scan + Socratic Agent TEST + #209 exit checklist | Complete ✅ — v0.8.0 released, Issue #209 closed |
| M9 UX architecture — EL Decision 1 (north-star formulation) | Adopted: per-mode formulation. Mode 1: trajectory reconstruction AND historical pattern recognition. Mode 2: threshold-safe path construction. Mode 3: real-time steering within human cost constraints. All 13 marquee cases validated. | Complete ✅ — recorded on #364 (2026-05-21) |
| M9 UX architecture — EL Decision 2 (viewport architecture) | Adopted: primary viewport is the instrument cluster. Zone 1B vs 1C superseded. EntityDetailDrawer demoted to detail/methodology surface. Entity selector is persistent header element. | Complete ✅ — recorded on #364 (2026-05-21) |
| M9 UX architecture — EL Decision 3 (comparison mode conditional) | Adopted: conditional switch extended to all three modes. Single-entity Mode 2: divergence timeline. Multi-entity Mode 2: DeltaChoropleth. Mode 3: automatic live A/B (no invoke). DeltaChoropleth deprecated for single-entity and Mode 3. | Complete ✅ — recorded on #364 (2026-05-21) |

## Key Decisions Made — Recent Sessions

| Decision | Rationale | Date |
|---|---|---|
| Milestone 11.5 established — usability validation milestone between M11 and M12 (2026-06-04) | GitHub Milestone 14 created: "Milestone 11.5 — Usability Validation and Experience Audit". North Star document merged as `docs/vision/milestone-11-5-north-star.md` (PR #715) — governing intent document, no prescription of methodology. Four issues filed: #717 (Pillar 1 — rrweb session recording, engineering prerequisite, FA Agent + DA Agent), #718 (Pillar 2 — cold-start usability audit methodology, PM + UX Designer + UX Design Thinking + PO Agents), #719 (Pillar 3 — session provenance standard and semantic component vocabulary, DA Agent + PM Agent), #720 (exit checklist). Gate sequence: #717 and #719 must close before #718 methodology is approved; #718 must close before any session begins. Exit criterion: can a finance ministry analyst with no prior WorldSim orientation produce a finding they could cite in a negotiation? | 2026-06-04 |
| M11 near-term issues re-milestoned to M12 + #681 political economy user stories authored (2026-06-04) | Two actions: (1) 17 open M11 near-term issues re-milestoned to M12 (GitHub milestone 13): #30 #43 #45 #92 #95 #102 #103 #259 #271 #274 #275 #392 #393 #644 #13 #22 #27. These are backlog/enhancement items not required for M11 closure; they carry to M12 alongside Mode 3 and external sector module work. (2) #681 (political economy module user stories) authored as retrospective specification against delivered G16a/G16b implementation. 20 Given/When/Then stories across 11 groups. Closes #681. PR #713 merged. M11 remaining gate: exit checklist #262 only. | 2026-06-04 |
| M11 board cleanup — 45 stale issues re-milestoned; Issue #40 reopened; elite capture #679 filed (2026-06-03) | Three actions: (1) PM HORIZON Step 6 gap filed — elite capture dynamics (#679, M11, enhancement, horizon:near-term) was a named roadmap deliverable with no tracking issue. Issue body defines scope (capture coefficient per sector/cohort, distributional divergence in human cost ledger, Argentina backtesting validation), dependencies (conditionality modelling, political feasibility constraints), and CM acceptance gate. (2) Issue #40 reopened — closure comment incorrectly equated the Human Cost Ledger ADR-005 (accepted, CLAUDE.md current) with the Non-Linear Propagation Architecture ADR that #40 actually tracked (never authored). Non-linear propagation ADR does not exist; Issue #29 (implementation) remains open on M11. Corrective comment posted explaining conflation. Re-milestoned to M11. (3) Batch re-milestoning: 22 open M9 issues and 22 open M10 issues moved to M11 (#30 #89 #102 #184 #349 #393 #513 #522–#529 #540 #542–#547 #574 + M9: #13 #49 #57 #98 #100 #121 #125 #127 #128 #158 #234 #252 #253 #258 #259 #276 #286 #299 #300 #374 #375 #412); #451 (Mode 1 COMPARE_VIEW) re-milestoned to M12 — Mode 1 is M12 territory. None of these represented missed M10/M9 core deliverables — all are backlog process, standards, and enhancement items. | 2026-06-03 |
| M10 FULLY CLOSED — Socratic Agent TEST complete (2026-06-03) | Socratic Agent TEST conducted at high-level architectural level (EL preference: no implementation-level detail). Three areas confirmed: (1) GovernanceModule promotion — null/tentative display → active threshold monitoring and full MDA alert participation; (2) PMM "—" at Step 3 Argentina — no policy headroom when all thresholds breached (governance floor + ecological boundary simultaneously); (3) Argentina fixture — Platform Principle validated, second country required no new engine modes or scenario-specific code, only new data inputs. Mental model confirmed sound. Comment posted on Issue #261. Issue #261 closed. M11 is now the active milestone. | 2026-06-03 |
| NM-032 + DEMO-018/019/020 from live application comparison (PR #676, 2026-06-03) | Engineering Lead compared a live application screenshot at Step 3/4 (>1440px display) against repository artifact frame-c (1280×720 Playwright capture). Three new MEDIUM findings: DEMO-018 (CI legend raw variable names — `getIndicatorDisplayNameAny()` fix covered AttributeSelector, not Recharts legend entries for derived keys; Issue #672), DEMO-019 (PMM "—" None state has no contextual explanation for non-specialists; Issue #673), DEMO-020 (Zone 1A y-axis tick labels clipped at left boundary when ecological score >1.0; `margin.left` too narrow for 6-char labels; invisible at 1280×720; Issue #674). Root cause: demo screenshot spec captures at 1280×720 while legibility gate validates at 1440×900 and live demo presents at ≥1440px — the review chain reviews a different visual artifact than what the stakeholder sees. NM-032 filed. Fix issue #675 (M11): set `page.setViewportSize({ width: 1440, height: 900 })` in demo spec before each capture; update SCREENSHOT_DIR to m10/screenshots/; update demo-preparation-standard Steps 4 and 6 with explicit viewport requirement. | 2026-06-03 |
| Step 6b internal team review process + M10 inaugural artifact (PR #666, closes #663, 2026-06-03) | Three-tier review structure (self-check → internal panel → IR Agent) documented in `demo-preparation-standard.md`. Step 6b defines the nine-agent panel (FA, UX Designer, UX Design Thinking, PO, Customer, QA Lead, DA, Chief Methodologist, Dev Economist), DEMO-NNN finding format, CRITICAL resolution criteria (a/b/c), and gate definition. Inaugural M10 artifact (`docs/demo/m10/reviews/2026-06-03-v0.10.0-internal-review.md`) produces DEMO-010 through DEMO-017. Four MEDIUM findings filed as #667–#670 (all M11, near-term). Internal Demo Reviews added to CLAUDE.md canonical artifact locations table. | 2026-06-03 |
| Demo/IR process gaps 2 + 4 remediated (PR #665, 2026-06-03) | Gap 2: demo cycle added as named step 4 of MILESTONE_RUNBOOK.md closure ceremony (even-numbered milestones only). Gap 4: HIGH finding tracking requirement added to Step 8 of `demo-preparation-standard.md` — issue number must appear in review artifact summary table before Step 9. Gaps 1 (severity vocabulary) + 3 (sequencing) filed as Issue #664 for M11. Gap 1 vocabulary corrected in Issue #663 body. | 2026-06-03 |
| CLAUDE.md frontend pre-push gate added (2026-06-03) — retrospective requirement #3 | For any branch modifying files under `frontend/src/`, run `cd frontend && npm run build` before pushing. Must exit 0. Adds a sibling rule to the existing backend pre-push lint gate. Near-miss record: SCAN-024 (7 TS6133 errors accumulated across M10 PRs without detection because this gate did not exist). This was the third blocking requirement from the M10 retrospective posted on Issue #261. | 2026-06-03 |
| M10 retrospective posted on Issue #261 (2026-06-03) | Three questions answered per CLAUDE.md §Milestone Retrospective Process. Three blocking M11 requirements identified: (1) Playwright E2E regression suite for Zone 1 before any Zone 1 refactor; (2) component rendering test for MDA columnWidth calculation before any Zone 1B layout change; (3) frontend TypeScript build added to pre-push gate (CLAUDE.md updated this session). Retrospective posted as comment on GitHub Issue #261. | 2026-06-03 |
| ADR license audit complete — all six ADRs extended to M11 (PR #661, 2026-06-03) | ADR-001: no triggers fired (no schema changes in M10). ADR-002: GovernanceModule `EMERGENCY_DECLARATION` is GovernanceModule-internal enum, not a `ControlInput` taxonomy addition — no trigger. ADR-005: Amendment 5 appended — GovernanceModule promotion 5/5 criteria met; M9 normalization obligation discharged; M9 tooltip obligation discharged (IR-005, #499). ADR-007: not implemented in M10, no Quantity schema changes. ADR-008: step_event_label content fix ≠ schema rename; Zone 1 implementation per spec is not a trigger. ADR-010: PMM API extension fields not consumed by TrajectoryView; note that ADR-009 streaming decision may trigger shared state architecture trigger in M11. | 2026-06-03 |
| Issues #22/#27/#43/#45 re-milestoned to M11 with deferral rationale (2026-06-03) | All four were `horizon:immediate` in M10 but undelivered. #22 (confidence_tier split): requires ADR-007 Quantity fields not yet implemented. #27 (Monte Carlo bands): cannot scope before ADR-009 (engine computation model, M11 core deliverable). #43 (backtesting harness): blocked by sparse matrix proof-of-concept (M11). #45 (fidelity dashboard): downstream of #43. Substantive rationale comments posted on each GitHub issue before re-milestoning. | 2026-06-03 |
| SCAN-024 compliance scan complete — 7 TS6133 errors fixed, CHANGELOG v0.10.0 merged (PR #660, 2026-06-03) | Ruff: clean (0 violations). TypeScript build: clean post-fix (7 TS6133 unused import errors on M10 new components + dead `ConfidenceBadge` component removed from `TrajectoryView.tsx`; `getConfidenceBadgeVisible()` predicate retained — exported and tested). mypy: not run locally (no venv); CI runs on every PR. SCAN-024 appended to scan-registry.md. ADR renewals flagged for M11. CHANGELOG v0.10.0 entry added. | 2026-06-03 |
| M10 stakeholder review artifact complete — PR #658 (2026-06-02) | Issue numbers added to all five IR-S7 findings in `docs/demo/m10/reviews/2026-06-02-v0.10.0-stakeholder-review.md`, matching M8 convention. IR-S7-001/002 → #647 (closed, PR #651); IR-S7-003 → #634 (demo umbrella, screenshot-resolution only); IR-S7-004 → #648 (closed, PR #650); IR-S7-005 → #342 (DEMO-001 root cause, M11 Option B). Summary table updated with Issue and Resolution columns. | 2026-06-02 |
| Stakeholder screen recording complete (2026-06-02) | EL ran the demo manually via `./scripts/demo.sh` + QuickTime at 1440×900 using the updated `docs/demo/stakeholder-walkthrough.md` script (PR #654). No Playwright re-run required — narration changes are in the script, not the application UI. | 2026-06-02 |
| NARRATION-RULING-1 codified — PR #655 (closes #652 process hardening) | Three-layer narration structure (umbrella → facts → synthesis) added as §16 to `docs/ux/standards.md`. Step 5c self-check added to `docs/process/demo-preparation-standard.md` — gates each milestone's walkthrough against NARRATION-RULING-1 before the IR Agent sees it. Prevents presenter-skill dependency for the "so what" at each demo step. | 2026-06-02 |
| Demo review naming consistency — NM-031, PR #656 | M10 review files renamed to canonical convention: `demo3-screenshot-ir.md` → `2026-06-02-v0.10.0-stakeholder-review.md`; `demo3-ir.md` → `2026-06-02-v0.10.0-pre-gate-triage.md`. Demo prep standard strengthened with explicit naming rule, mandatory pre-creation `find` command, canonical suffix definitions. Root cause: standard stated the pattern in a folder diagram but had no enforcement step. | 2026-06-02 |
| Demo 3 Step 9 complete — stakeholder demo session confirmed end-to-end (PRs #649–#651) | Playwright demo spec ran at 1440×900 (1 passed, 4.3m). Five frames captured. PMM trajectory API confirmed: Steps 0–1 = 0.2857 (governance headroom ≈ 0.29, CO2 breach excluded), Step 2 = 0.4286 (↑ Kirchner improvement), Steps 3–4 = None (governance threshold breached). Zone 1B full-density cards render at 400px column (WARNING cards legible). Issues #634/#647/#648/#345 closed. Issue #652 filed (narration legibility — umbrella framing and synthesis; M10 Near-Term). | 2026-06-02 |
| PMM breach-exclusion fix — skip breached thresholds (PR #650, closes #648) | Root cause: ecological CO2 boundary (≥ 1.0) breached from step 0 in Argentina (seed ≈ 1.056); old min(margins) collapsed to 0, masking governance headroom. Fix: `_compute_pmm_for_step` skips thresholds with margin == 0. MDA alerts carry the breach signal; PMM measures remaining headroom on non-breached thresholds. Returns None when all thresholds breached (shown as "—" in UI). 31 unit tests pass; three new tests replace `test_min_across_thresholds` (which encoded the old wrong contract). | 2026-06-02 |
| Zone 1B responsive columnWidth fix (PR #651, closes #647) | Root cause: `MDAAlertPanelZone1B` hardcoded `columnWidth={240}` in ScenarioInstrumentCluster — always compact (11px, abbreviated labels) regardless of viewport. At 1440×900 the co-primary column is 400px → should be full-density (12px, full severity labels, untruncated names). Fix: exported `LAYOUT` and `useViewportBreakpoint` from InstrumentCluster; ScenarioInstrumentCluster now passes `LAYOUT[bp].coPrimary` as columnWidth. Resolves IR-S7-001 (CRITICAL) from Demo 3 IR review. | 2026-06-02 |
| EL decision — Demo 3 narration legibility gap (Issue #652) | Narration delivers facts without scaffolding: no umbrella sentence (why now?), no synthesis sentence (so what?), no connective tissue between steps. Same compression-over-legibility problem as Issue #621 applied to narration. EL instructed: file Issue #652, assign M10 Near-Term; independent reviewer activation using senior fiscal policy analyst framing (someone who has sat on both sides of a programme negotiation). UX Designer Agent is R; PM Agent is C. Rewrite should not change factual content — only add framing. | 2026-06-02 |
| Financial narration EL decision — Step 4 wording (PR #645) | Replaced "the financial arc has recovered" with honest scope framing: directs audience to the GDP indicator panel (showing +9%), acknowledges the Kirchner recovery is real, notes governance healing slowly, and explicitly names the recovery arc as M11 scope. Resolves the demo-blocking narration gap identified in Demo 3 review (Issue #634). Three M11 issues filed from panel review: #642 (EmergencyPolicyInput integration test — mandatory before M11 exit), #643 (ESLint exhaustive-deps audit), #644 (setTrajectory refactor — must not set current_step as side effect). All three assigned to Milestone 11 via GitHub API. | 2026-06-02 |
| Demo 3 CRITICAL bug cluster fixed + screenshots captured (PR #639) | Four bugs fixed: (1) `ScenarioInstrumentCluster.tsx` trajectory useEffect depended only on `[scenarioId]` — never re-fetched after step advances; fixed to `[scenarioId, currentStep]` with step-0 guard. (2) `setTrajectory` store action sets `current_step: trajectory.step_count`, clobbering prop-driven step; fixed by immediately re-asserting `currentStep` after `setTrajectory`. (3) GovernanceModule `_SUBSCRIBED_EVENTS` used bare instrument names (`"emergency_declaration"`); `EmergencyPolicyInput.to_events()` emits `"emergency_policy_emergency_declaration"` — corrected throughout module + elasticity registry + unit tests. (4) EcologicalModule temporal guard blocked pre-2009 CO2 proximity for Argentina (2001 start); fixed with per-constant `retroactive` flag; `_fetch_active_boundary_constants` changed to `WHERE effective_from <= NOW()`. Five Demo 3 screenshots captured with real data. Governance MDA-GOV-DEMOCRACY-FLOOR fires at step 3 (DQS 0.665 < 0.70). IR-004 Playwright test fixed: `page.waitForResponse` before `advanceStep`, then `page.waitForFunction` polls DOM for year text. Known gap: financial composite stays 0.0000 from step 2 (Kirchner recovery not in fixture) — narration "financial arc recovered" does not match instrument output; decision required before demo session. | 2026-06-02 |
| NM-028/029/030 filed + panel review posted (PR #640, comment on #634) | Three near-misses filed: NM-028 (IR-004 silent no-op — hasSvg guard returned early for one milestone; same anti-pattern as NM-027; no-op check not run at wire-up merge boundary); NM-029 (GovernanceModule event_type false positive coverage — 25 unit tests passed with wrong synthetic event_type strings, never crossing EmergencyPolicyInput adapter; highest-severity of the three); NM-030 (EcologicalModule temporal guard silently blocked retroactive CO2 proximity for pre-2009 backtesting without user-visible error). Four-agent panel review (Architect, Frontend Architect, QA Lead, UX Designer) posted to Issue #634. Key panel findings: `setTrajectory` should not set `current_step` (FA — store design flaw, follow-up issue needed); ESLint `exhaustive-deps` rule should be audited and enforced (would have caught the useEffect missing-dependency bug); integration test required for input adapter → subscriber event_type contract; financial 0.0000 vs. "recovered" narration is a demo-blocking UX gap requiring EL decision. | 2026-06-02 |
| M10 Immediate process sweep complete (PR #635) — 8 issues closed | MILESTONE_RUNBOOK.md table corrected to M0–M13; CONTRIBUTING.md stale develop-branch instructions replaced; ADR threshold criteria table added to CODING_STANDARDS.md; "ADRs Affected" and Playwright phases 3–4 attestation added to PR checklist; Customer Agent added as 13th standing consultation obligation (UX-facing ADRs); step_event_label mandatory field standard added to DATA_STANDARDS.md; Greece fixture annotated with step_metadata; FidelityDashboard M7 labels updated to M11. Remaining M10 Immediate: #261 (exit checklist), #345 (DEMO-004 manual run), #634 (demo prep Steps 2–6, Step 7, 8, 9). | 2026-06-02 |
| IR review (PR #618) is a pre-gate triage artifact, not the Step 7 review for Issue #634 | The earlier IR review predates UX-RULING-4 and was conducted without screenshots. Step 7 on Issue #634 remains unchecked. The proper Step 7 review requires: Steps 2–6 complete (UX Agent screenshot brief, demo.sh update, Playwright spec update, walkthrough update, screenshot capture), then a fresh IR session with screenshots in UX Agent brief sequence and UX-RULING-4 narration discipline in scope. | 2026-06-02 |
| docs/demo/ RACI ownership established; UX/UI standards document created (PR #631) | PM Agent is now R on `docs/demo/` — demo preparation is a blocking exit requirement per milestone. `docs/ux/standards.md` created as the canonical consolidated standards document (15 sections, 15 settled decisions). EL sign-off required for any new standard or existing change. UX Designer Agent is R; Frontend Architect Agent is Required C. | 2026-06-02 |
| UX-RULING-4 — choropleth is a context surface, not a change instrument; #342/DEMO-001 closed as narration-fix scope | FA Agent proposed two fixes for DEMO-001 (HUD overlay on choropleth; supplementary Zone 1D attribute row). UX Designer declined both as hierarchy inversions. Ruling reframed the root cause: the demo narration was pointing at the wrong instrument. M10 fix: narration update only (child #628, PR #629). M11 fix: Option B scenario-relative color scale (requires cross-step range endpoint — scoped for M11). Zone 1D is composite scores only (no raw indicator rows) until a new UX ruling authorises an expansion. | 2026-06-02 |
| DEMO issue dispositions — full sweep complete (2026-06-02) | Closed: #342 (DEMO-001, narration), #343 (DEMO-002, redesign), #346 (DEMO-005, redesign), #348 (DEMO-007, #616 fix), #350 (DEMO-009, #617 fix), #379 (demo standard), #628 (narration script). Left open: #345 (DEMO-004, investigation required — manual Argentina demo run needed), #349 (DEMO-008, screenshot naming — near-term, addressed in demo standard Step 6). | 2026-06-02 |
| DEMO issue dispositions — #348/DEMO-007 + #350/DEMO-009 closed; #345/DEMO-004 data precondition noted (2026-06-02) | #348 (DEMO-007, "boundary reference absent") closed — resolved by PR #622 (#616: `ecological-boundary-note` span; regression-guarded by `demo-legibility.spec.ts` in PR #626). #350 (DEMO-009, "attribute selector raw field names") closed — resolved by PR #622 (#617: `getIndicatorDisplayNameAny()` wired). #345 (DEMO-004, "alerts appear identical across steps") left open with data-precondition comment: PR #624 (#615) provides Argentina governance alert variation at step 3; the test gate is `demo-advancement-flow.spec.ts` test 3 (Zone 1B live/non-blank). Close #345 after a full demo run-through confirms visual accumulation end-to-end. #342/343/346/349 remain open (not addressed by this session's PRs). | 2026-06-02 |
| Demo 3 readiness gate COMPLETE — PRs #622 + #624 (2026-06-02) | All three IR-M10 gate items closed: #615 (governance MDA breach — `emergency_declaration` at step 2, GovernanceModule one-step lag → score 0.665 at step 3 ≤ 0.70 floor); #616 (Zone 1D ecological annotation — "1.0 = boundary" sub-label); #617 (AttributeSelector display names — `getIndicatorDisplayNameAny()`). Demo 3 is presentation-ready. Root cause of #615: fixture comment falsely claimed `emergency_declaration` was already in base scheduled_inputs; it was not; `default_declaration` is not subscribed by GovernanceModule. | 2026-06-02 |
| Demo 3 IR review complete — PR #618 (2026-06-02) | IR review at `docs/demo/m10/reviews/2026-06-02-v0.10.0-pre-gate-triage.md` (renamed from `demo3-ir.md` for naming consistency — NM-031). All six M9 IR findings (IR-001–IR-006) confirmed closed by M10 PRs. DEMO issue re-triage: #347 (DEMO-006) CLOSED — governance live; #342 (DEMO-001) Critical→Minor — Zone 1A is primary instrument; #343 (DEMO-002) Substantially resolved; #346 (DEMO-005) Significant→Minor — Zone 1D covers it. Three new findings: IR-M10-001 (Argentina MDA accumulation uncertainty → #615), IR-M10-002 (ecological Zone 1D annotation gap → #616), IR-M10-003 (AttributeSelector raw field names → #617). Demo 3 readiness gate: #615/#616/#617 must close before Demo 3 presentation. Positive: all four Zone 1 instruments live, governance live (4th axis solid, no longer dashed), Platform Principle demonstrated. | 2026-06-02 |
| ARCH-REVIEW-006 complete — Issue #577 scope review; 11 child issues filed (#603–#614) | Architecture Review Facilitator TARGETED review produced 16 blindspots across US-039/042/043/048. One Immediate blocker: CM vocabulary mapping standard (#603, AR-006-B-007) must be authored before US-043 implementation begins. 11 GitHub Issues filed as Issue #577 children (#603–#614) with tracking comment on #577. Zone 1/2 bidirectional coupling atom (AR-006-B-011, #609) and Zone 2 multi-view model (AR-006-B-012, #610) are the two architectural pre-decisions for US-048. Branch-and-recompute CE assessment (AR-006-B-001, #604) is the prerequisite for US-039 M12 scoping. `docs/architecture/reviews/ARCH-REVIEW-006-milestone10.md`. | 2026-06-02 |
| EL decision — US-039 milestone confirmed M12 | No urgency to pull US-039 (Mode 3 real-time parameter change) into M11. Mode 3 is the M12 core deliverable; building the control plane form before Mode 3 instrumentation exists would be premature. Exception path (Mode 2 quick-create variant) not pursued. Issue #577 pre-activation blocker resolved. | 2026-06-02 |
| US-043 No False Precision correction applied (PR #598) | PI-REVIEW-002 F-005 resolved. Three changes to `docs/ux/user-stories-public-advocacy-m10.md`: (1) north-star sentence: "removes confidence tier notation" → "replaces technical confidence tier notation with plain-language epistemic disclosure"; (2) technical-notation criterion scoped to primary content only, with cross-reference to disclosure criterion; (3) new acceptance criterion added: for any indicator with confidence_tier ≥ 3, community report must contain plain-language epistemic disclosure per vocabulary mapping standard (Tier 3 → "Based on a model estimate from comparable countries"; Tier 4 → "This is an estimated figure — independent verification recommended"; Tier 5 → "Insufficient data — the model could not compute this reliably"). Chief Methodologist is Required Consultant on vocabulary mapping standard before implementation begins. QA may now write the pytest criterion for disclosure presence. | 2026-06-02 |
| PI-REVIEW-002 complete — Issue #577 scope assessed (PR #596) | Four [Phase-3-TBD] stories from Issue #576 classified: US-039 → Extension of Mode 3 (M12; exception path to M11 if Mode 2 variant confirmed by UX Designer); US-042 → Post-processing overlay recommended — epistemically correct; Mode 4 rejected; Mode 1 extension possible with DA input (M11); US-043 → Standalone rendering/export tool — HIGH No False Precision risk: acceptance criteria must add plain-language epistemic disclosure vocabulary (Tier 3/4/5) before implementation begins (M11); US-048 → New Zone 2 surface + backend provenance API — bidirectional Zone 1/2 coupling novel; Chief Engineer gates on graph traversal feasibility; ADR-009 may be prerequisite (M11 or M12). Key process clarification: correct Issue #577 activation is `Architecture Review: TARGETED`, not `Council Orchestrator: ORCHESTRATE`. Pre-activation blockers: PO Agent corrects US-043 acceptance criteria; EL confirms US-039 milestone. | 2026-06-02 |
| Issue #576 closed — public advocacy user journeys and stories complete (PR #594) | Journeys E–H added to `docs/ux/user-journeys.md`: Journey E (Farida Haidari — Pakistan 2022 combined-shock story investigation; Layer 3 constraint; 2-hour cap; MDA plain-language exit), Journey F (James Ochieng — Kenya EFF committee brief; 72-hour Hansard standard; ADR methodology citation; downloadable tabular output), Journey G (Abena Osei — Ghana ECF accountability monitoring; Option C ratified: Mode 2 committed baseline is genuine service; observed-actuals overlay and community output layer classified [Phase-3-TBD]), Journey H (Dr. Priya Krishnaswamy — India 2020 farm law backtesting vs. Wardha field data; 5pp divergence accepted within plausible range given comparison group; X-ray layer [Phase-3-TBD] in Zone 2). `docs/ux/user-stories-public-advocacy-m10.md` created: 19 stories US-030–US-048 — 6 [Playwright] QA-unblocked, 9 [Near-Term-Gap] blocked pending tracking issues, 4 [Phase-3-TBD] as formal input to Issue #577. Retrospective entry state extended in dependency map with two sub-modes (historical calibration / accountability tracking). | 2026-06-02 |
| Issue #575 closed — public advocacy personas panel complete (PR #592) | Four additions to `docs/ux/personas.md`: Persona 6 (Investigative Journalist — Farida Haidari, Dawn/Pakistan; primary cognitive task is producing a single publishable sentence from the MDA alert panel without specialist mediation; marquee case: Pakistan 2022 flood + IMF energy subsidy combined-shock failing the programme's bottom-quintile protection assumption); Persona 7 (Parliamentary Economist — James Ochieng, Kenya PBO; 72-hour deadline and Hansard citation standard; marquee case: Kenya 2023 EFF committee minority report that lacked specific threshold/step/cohort evidence); Persona 8 (Civil Society Monitor — Abena Osei, SEND Ghana; Retrospective accountability sub-mode; marquee case: Ghana 2023 ECF social protection floor breach; platform gap: integrated observed-actuals input not yet a capability); Persona 4V (Personal-Connection Researcher — Dr. Priya Krishnaswamy, CDS/JNU; Vidarbha cotton farmer father; marquee case: The Wardha Divergence — backtesting India 2020 farm law deregulation against 47-household field survey). Retrospective entry state extended to two sub-modes (historical calibration + accountability tracking). No 7th entry state required. | 2026-06-02 |
| Argentina Demo 3 complete — Issue #553 closed (PR #590) | `build_argentina_demo_scenario()` added to `tests/fixtures/argentina_2001_2002_scenario.py` following the `build_greece_demo_scenario()` pattern. Extends the 2-step backtesting base to 4 steps (2001–2004 arc through Kirchner recovery). EcologicalModule enabled with CO2 seed 369.5 ppm (NOAA MLO 2000); GovernanceModule enabled with rule_of_law_percentile=33.2 (WGI ARG 2000) and democratic_quality_score=0.71 (V-Dem LDI ARG 2000). step_metadata event labels: step 1 "Zero Deficit Plan / Blindaje" (SIGNIFICANT), step 2 "Default / Peso devaluation" (SIGNIFICANT), step 3 "Kirchner recovery begins" (SIGNIFICANT), step 4 ROUTINE. Latent bug fixed: `step_metadata` added as declared field to `ScenarioConfigSchema` in `app/schemas.py` — field was already read by the trajectory endpoint from `cfg_raw` but was silently stripped by Pydantic on POST. Demo walkthrough script at `backend/scripts/demo_argentina_2001_2002.py`. 21 new unit tests (51 total in `test_argentina_backtesting_fixtures.py`). | 2026-06-02 |
| NM-027 — AC-007/AC-008 silent no-ops; QA Lead + FA process improvements (PR #570, closes #568, #571) | AC-007 (trajectory-render performance mark) and AC-008 (advance-step-btn testid) were silent no-ops for one full milestone. `TrajectoryView.tsx`: `useLayoutEffect` + `requestAnimationFrame` pattern fires `performance.measure("trajectory-render-initial", ...)` once per mount. `ScenarioControls.tsx`: `data-testid="advance-step-btn"` added to advance button. Four process findings encoded: QA-NM027-F1 (HORIZON skip audit extended to `if (value !== null)` guard pattern); QA-NM027-F2 (guarded tests must carry explicit implementation dependency record); FA-NM027-F1 (pre-PR checklist distinguishes structural vs behavioural ACs); FA-NM027-F2 (FA brief authorship standard — `[behavioural]` annotation required). Issue #550 (MV-002) unblocked. Issue #569 (M12 AC-009 re-run) open. | 2026-06-01 |
| CI playwright-e2e fixed — system Chrome replaces CDN download (PR #570) | Five consecutive `playwright-e2e` cancellations traced to Playwright Chromium CDN delivering at ~40 KB/s on free-tier runner (~60-min download). Fix: `playwright.config.ts` uses `channel: "chrome"` (system-installed Google Chrome on ubuntu-latest runners — no download). `ci.yml`: removed cache + conditional install steps; kept only `npx playwright install-deps chromium` (fast apt-get, ~2 min). Timeout restored to 30 min. CI green on first run after fix. | 2026-06-01 |
| Issue #514 complete — Phase 1 engine baseline benchmarks (PRs #565 + #566) | Script (`backend/scripts/benchmark_phase1.py`) and results document (`docs/architecture/engine-baseline-benchmarks-m10.md`) merged. Two machines measured: M1 Pro dev machine and ProBook (i5-8265U, 8 GiB, Windows 11). Key findings: (1) edge density, not entity count, drives propagation cost; (2) ProBook throughput ~5,750 MC runs/s — within interactive budget; (3) memory negligible (< 0.2 MiB at largest config); (4) no blocking constraint for ADR-009. Five findings documented for ADR-009 authoring. | 2026-05-31 |
| Python 3.12 → 3.13 upgrade — PR #564 | pyproject.toml, .python-version, ci.yml (4 jobs), and CONTRIBUTING.md updated to Python 3.13. Rationale: dev machine runs 3.13.11; benchmark comparisons require identical Python version across machines; upgrading configs is correct over downgrading dev environment. | 2026-05-31 |
| IB + DQ agents fully defined; CE activated — PR #563 (closes #523 + #524) | IB Agent (Intent Block Author): full working agreement, RACI row 7 promoted I→R (divergence detection is compliance function), activation prompt template at `docs/process/intent-block-author-prompt.md`. DQ Agent (Data Quality): full working agreement, certification battery, activation prompt template at `docs/process/data-quality-agent-prompt.md`. CE Agent: status promoted Defined-inactive → Active (M10, Issue #514). PM HORIZON step 7: Defined-inactive activation audit added (checks open milestone board against each Defined-inactive agent's trigger each sweep). | 2026-05-31 |
| Recurring metadata alignment check — PR #562 (closes #561) | MILESTONE_RUNBOOK.md: Kickoff Gate step 0 (four-artifact metadata alignment check) and Closure Ceremony step 7 (same check before next milestone creation) added. Four artifacts: GitHub milestone title/description, CLAUDE.md §What We Are Building First, CLAUDE.md §Milestone Roadmap, roadmap.md. Root cause of six M10 kickoff discrepancies: no ceremony step prompted the check. | 2026-05-31 |
| M10 kickoff gate complete (2026-05-30) — PR #557 | PM Agent scope-completeness check run against CLAUDE.md and roadmap. Finding 1 RESOLVED: GovernanceModule promotion was untracked — Issue #556 filed (M10 Immediate, five ADR-005 criteria). Finding 2 EL DECISION PENDING: #221 (mean-reversion channel) — roadmap stated "hard constraint, cannot be deferred past M10" but board split moved it to M11; EL must choose Option A (revert #221 to M10) or Option B (accept M11 deferral + roadmap update). Roadmap updated (PR #557): Argentina confirmed (#553), Phase 1 benchmarks in M10 (#514), scope linkage issue numbers added. Kickoff baseline posted on exit checklist #261. Pre-implementation gate sequence: #523 → #524 → EL decision on #221 → #514 → #550. No implementation PR may open until EL confirms baseline. | 2026-05-30 |
| M10/M11 issue split executed (2026-05-30) | Four-batch milestone reorganization: (1) 11 unmilestoned issues → M10 Immediate (#514, #523, #524, #535–#539, #541, #543, #550); (2) 12 unmilestoned issues → M10 Near-Term (#522, #525–#529, #540, #542, #544–#547); (3) 11 Demo-3-critical issues upgraded M10 Near-Term → M10 Immediate (#342, #343, #345–#348, #350, #496–#498, #500); (4) 23 engine/SA-* standards issues pushed M10 → M11 (#29, #44, #46, #91–#92, #95, #103, #116, #118–#119, #122–#123, #147, #151–#152, #154–#155, #160, #173, #221–#222, #271, #275). Board: M10 = 54 open (34 Immediate / 20 Near-Term), M11 = 42 open, unmilestoned = 0. Kept in M10 (foundational, ADR-007/Demo 3 prerequisites): #22, #27, #30, #43, #45, #89, #102, #184, #451. | 2026-05-30 |
| Argentina 2000–2002 second country fixture filed — Issue #553 | Demo 3 anchor issue filed: `feat(fixture): Argentina 2000–2002 second country fixture — IMF debt crisis (Demo 3)`. Milestone: M10, horizon:immediate. CM data availability check is the blocking prerequisite before implementation begins — CM must validate all core WorldSim indicators at Tier 1–2 for the 1999–2003 window (IMF IFS/WEO, WDI, INDEC 2000–2002 pre-manipulation era, V-Dem, ILO, UNESCO). Argentina selected over Iceland 2008–2011 and South Korea 1997–1999: IMF SBA data Tier 1, INDEC 2000–2002 Tier 1–2 (pre-manipulation), V-Dem Tier 1, distinct political economy from Greece. Demo 3 requires all four Zone 1 axes live with Argentina data + Greece comparison. | 2026-05-30 |
| Issue Disposition Audit SOP + NM-026 (PR #551) | Codified milestone exit issue cleanup as a blocking pre-step in MILESTONE_RUNBOOK.md §Issue Disposition Audit. Root: Issue #514 closed COMPLETED during M9 exit without delivering the benchmark document — NM-020 referenced it (documented the gap) which EL interpreted as resolution. Three rules now explicit: (1) COMPLETED closures require PR or EL comment; (2) near-miss filing does not close the issue it references; (3) manual gates must have GitHub issues. NM-026 filed (Reactive, High). Issue #514 reopened (M10 blocking prerequisite for ADR-009). Issue #550 created for MV-002 frontend render baseline. M9 exit window audit: #514 confirmed only bad closure; all others legitimate. | 2026-05-29 |
| PI-AUDIT-002 complete (PR #548) — end-to-end pipeline audit | All 8 pipeline stages documented. 14 findings (F-RUNBOOK-1, F-CONTRIB-1, F-AGENTS-1/2, F-PIPELINE-1/2/3/4, F-ADR-1 through F-ADR-9). Capstone: Political Feasibility Score widget traced through 14 pipeline steps — 5 FRAGILE or BREAKDOWN. Three near-miss entries filed (NM-023: CONTRIBUTING.md "branch from develop" stale; NM-024: Playwright phases 3–4 not CI-enforceable; NM-025: demo story ownership gap). 13 GitHub issues filed (#535–#547). Highest-leverage M10 blockers: #538 (ADR threshold criteria), #541 (cross-ADR impact PR field), #543 (Playwright enforcement). Audit doc: `docs/process/audits/PI-AUDIT-002-pipeline-2026-05-25.md`. | 2026-05-25 |
| Customer Agent defined (PR #533, closes #532) | Active agent (CU) for Layer 3 institutional capacity asymmetry — the gap identified in PI-REVIEW-001 F-001. Mandate: ensure WorldSim outputs are usable without specialist mediation by Personas 2 (Ministry Negotiator), 3 (Political Advisor), and 5 (Institutional Decision-Maker). Canonical question: does this output make sense to Aicha Mbaye's chief of staff, alone with a tablet, in five minutes, without Lucas Ferreira in the room? Three activation modes: AUDIT (Layer 3 usability pass/fail), ADOPTION (institutional adoption pathway), BRIEF (customer voice for EL). Standing gates: 90-second retrieval window (Persona 2 Reactive) and 5-minute demonstration window (Persona 5 Reactive). RACI: C on Rows 1/2/3/8; R on docs/customer/ artifacts. Three standing consultation obligations added to agent-raci.md cross-agent patterns (CU → UX Designer, CU → PO, CU → Ar). File authority: agents.md (PM R ✓, EL C satisfied by EXECUTE); agent-raci.md decision-type grounding additions flagged for Ar review per NM-021. | 2026-05-25 |
| PI Agent REVIEW — agent team organization (PR #530, closes no issue — REVIEW mode produces findings doc) | Agent team assessed against the Founding Document's three-layered asymmetry frame. Nine findings across six concrete gaps (F-001–F-006) and three systemic observations (S-001–S-004, S-001 descriptive only). Key structural gap: Layer 3 information asymmetry (institutional capacity) has no dedicated agent. Secondary gaps: backtesting Eureka function (learning from historical divergences) has no owner; IB and DQ agents must be defined before M10 implementation begins; CE activation trigger has fired (Issue #514 commissioned) but CE remains defined-inactive; Mode 3 zone compatibility has no standing implementation gate; DIC blind interview protocol not encoded at the individual member level. Nine GitHub issues filed (#521–#529). Comment filed on Issue #278 (technocratic emigration orphan — M11 triage recommendation). Findings document: `docs/process/audits/PI-REVIEW-001-agent-team-2026-05-25.md`. | 2026-05-25 |
| PI Agent inaugural four-lens audit complete (PR #519) | Registry lens: near-miss registry header corrected (PM→PI), count updated (19→22 entries). Process adherence lens: two file authority violations across PRs #515 and #517 filed as NM-021. Compliance lens: scan ordering inversion corrected (SCAN-022 before SCAN-023) — third occurrence confirmed systemic. Systemic lens: stale cross-reference pattern filed as NM-022 (CE ADR ref stale 3+ milestones; registry header stale after PR #517; no standing detection process). Process improvements applied: PM Agent and Implementation Agents pre-commit checklists (file authority check per NM-021); PI Agent working agreement (enhanced scan ordering rule; ownership transfer checklist per NM-022); Architect Agent AMEND mode (ADR number cross-reference grep per NM-022); agent-raci.md Notes column clarifications for backlog.md and agent-raci.md rows (per NM-021). | 2026-05-25 |
| Process Integrity Agent defined (PR #517, closes #516) | New standing agent (PI) owns the process health evidence trail: near-miss-registry.md, known-issues-registry.md, compliance scan registry, ADR license audit. PM becomes Informed on registry files; PI is author of record. Four activation modes: REGISTER, AUDIT (four-lens: registry health / process adherence / compliance / systemic clustering), SCAN, REVIEW. File ownership transferred: near-miss-registry.md + known-issues-registry.md PM→PI; scan-registry.md Sr→PI (Sr becomes Required C on security-relevant findings). PM working agreement updated: PM determines categorization, routes to `Process Integrity Agent: REGISTER`. PI added to RACI matrix: R on rows 6 (process/milestone) and 7 (compliance). CE stale ref fixed in agent-raci.md Agent Key and Cells with Implicit I Only (ADR-007 → ADR-009). | 2026-05-25 |
| NM-020 filed — backend compute baseline gap; stale CE ADR ref fixed; backlog prerequisite clause rule added (PR #515) | Phase 1 baseline benchmarks for the iterative simulation engine (comprehensive profiling: per-step cost at 1/10/100 entities, propagation cost as edges scale, Monte Carlo throughput) were never established as a tracked work item despite being listed as a prerequisite for ADR-009 authoring across three milestones. Root causes: (1) backlog Notes "Do not author until X" creates no GitHub issue; (2) stale CE ADR reference in agents.md (ADR-007 → ADR-009 in three locations); (3) naming collision — MV-002 is a frontend render gate, not a compute baseline; (4) Chief Engineer Defined-inactive with no HORIZON obligation for its activation prerequisite. Five process improvements: Issue #514 filed (Phase 1 baseline benchmarks, assign to M10 when created); agents.md stale refs corrected; backlog prerequisite clause rule added to docs/architecture/backlog.md; MV-002 explicitly scoped as frontend-only in mv-gates.md; HORIZON check extension documented. | 2026-05-25 |
| ADR-007 accepted — Synthetic Data Framework (PR #510, closes #508) | Seven-section framework: five-method hierarchy (Bayesian > MICE > Bootstrap > Structural Extrapolation > Structural Absence), mandatory per-indicator disclosure (never suppressible), scenario banding (pessimistic/realistic/optimistic), confidence tier sub-labels (Tiers 3–5), MDA alert behavior by tier (Tier 3 advisory amber / Tier 4 secondary panel only / Tier 5 none), three-condition meaninglessness threshold, anomaly detection (TSC sign-off required). Four INCORPORATE items applied from panel review (CM, Data Architect, Development Economist). `Quantity` gains 4 new fields: `is_synthetic: bool`, `synthetic_method: str \| None`, `comparison_group_id: str \| None`, `holdout_validated: bool \| None` — all new, none pre-existing. Comparison group registry follows `source_registry` pattern (Issue #300, managed by Data Quality Agent). ADR-007 Mermaid flowchart at `docs/architecture/ADR-007-method-selection-flowchart.mmd`. ARCH-001 in backlog: ACCEPTED. | 2026-05-23 |
| ADR-005 Amendment 4 — GovernanceModule M9 exit formal assessment (PR #509, closes #507) | Five promotion criteria assessed: all Not Met. GovernanceModule formally deferred to M10. M9 Governance Normalization Obligation recorded: before specifying governance composite score strategy, must audit each of five indicators for absolute threshold equivalents (V-Dem electoral autocracy threshold, RSF press freedom floor, WJP rule of law breakpoints). ADR-005 M8-5 tooltip obligation updated: Target M9 → Target M10. License renewed for M10. | 2026-05-23 |
| Document referencing convention — Issue #398 resolved (PR #510) | Three conventions added to `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md §Document Referencing Convention`: (1) revision header on all living documents (format specified); (2) ADRs as stable reference points vs. living documents; (3) PR Cross-references section — required field on all PRs that update a living document. Revision headers added to six living documents: `north-star.md`, `information-hierarchy.md`, `user-journeys.md`, `simulation-framework.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/process/agents.md`. PR template updated. CONTRIBUTING.md updated. | 2026-05-23 |
| STD-REVIEW-005 complete — M9 exit standards gap inventory (PR #510, closes #439) | Eight gaps total. Carried from STD-REVIEW-004: (1) no canonical unit registry (#252), (2) no field-level data certification (#252), (3) WGI territorial convention (no Issue), (4) [SIM-INTEGRITY] logging formal section (promote to Immediate for M10). New M9 gaps: M9-1 synthetic data tier floor (#508 implementation gate), M9-2 `step_event_label` mandatory fixture field (#395), M9-3 per-indicator badge disclosure (no Issue), M9-4 document referencing convention (RESOLVED this PR). Three M10 kickoff gates: (1) [SIM-INTEGRITY] logging section before first M10 engine PR; (2) `step_event_label` in DATA_STANDARDS.md before first M10 backtesting fixture; (3) synthetic data tier floor in DATA_STANDARDS.md before Quantity schema extension Alembic migration. Schema drift check: no drift (M9 docs-only). | 2026-05-23 |
| SCAN-023 filed — M9 milestone-exit compliance scan (PR #510) | Documentation-only milestone — no simulation code, no Python/TypeScript/Alembic files, no compliance scan tool applicable. All ADRs CURRENT at M9 exit: ADR-001/002 renewed for M10; ADR-007 accepted 2026-05-23; ADR-008/010 accepted 2026-05-22; ADR-003/004/005/006 reviewed and CURRENT. 809 unit tests unchanged from M8 (no code shipped in M9). Three M10 kickoff gates documented in STD-REVIEW-005. | 2026-05-23 |
| ADR-001 and ADR-002 license renewals — Valid Until M10 (PR #510) | ADR-001 (Simulation Core Data Model): `Valid Until` extended to Milestone 10. M9 exit review entry added: no renewal triggers fired — M9 was documentation-only. M8 exit review entry added (SCAN-022, previously missing). ADR-002 (Input Orchestration Layer): same pattern. M9 review note: ADR-007 adds Quantity fields — this is NOT an ADR-002 trigger (ControlInput taxonomy unchanged). | 2026-05-23 |
| All M9 horizon:immediate issues closed or formally deferred (Issue #213 comment) | Formal deferral comment posted on Issue #213 covering all remaining open M9 issues. Issues closed this session: #507 (ADR-005 Amendment 4), #508 (ADR-007 accepted), #251 (architecture backlog), #378 (architecture backlog process), #439 (STD-REVIEW-005), #398 (document referencing convention). M9 is now in human-gate phase. | 2026-05-23 |
| Issue #493 closed — M9 IR review + M8 DEMO triage complete (PR #501) | IR review at `docs/demo/m9/reviews/2026-05-23-v0.9-instrument-cluster-ir.md`. Six findings (IR-001–IR-006) filed as #495–#500 for M10. Two root causes: (A) data layer not wired to Zone 1B/1C — mda_alerts always [], PMM always null; (B) session state and entry-state architecture not implemented — landing screen is choropleth, step annotations absent for user-created scenarios. Root Cause B from M8 (drawer legibility) fully resolved by M9 architecture. M8 DEMO triage: #344 closed (text legibility resolved); #342/#343/#346/#347/#349 transformed + re-milestoned to M10; #345/#348/#350 persist to M10. Six M10 issues: #495 (IR-001 Critical — mda_alerts wiring), #496 (IR-002 — PMM endpoint), #497 (IR-003 — persistent scenario state/demonstrative entry), #498 (IR-004 — default step labels from start year), #499 (IR-005 — governance "(in validation)" inline), #500 (IR-006 — loading state). | 2026-05-23 |
| Issue #463 fully closed — Zone 1 cluster live in App.tsx + Greece Playwright suite (PRs #489–#491) | PR #489 closed the four remaining QA acceptance test gaps (#459): ModeIndicator component + 13 Vitest tests; AC-006 RTL atomicity test (act() boundary, Vitest cleanup fix); AC-013 "(exp)" confidence badge Playwright guard; US-026 mode-indicator RTL act() test. PR #490 wired InstrumentCluster into App.tsx via ScenarioInstrumentCluster: trajectory fetch + parse (array→Record, Decimal string→number, boundary_proximity→normalized_absolute); data-testid duplication fixed in InstrumentCluster wrapper divs. PR #491 completed Issue #463 PR 2: removed test.skip() from AC-001/AC-002; added selectScenario() helper; created greece-integration.spec.ts (5 tests: smoke, mode indicator "Replay", data-current-step tracking, governance null AC-015, per-step cluster consistency + Mode 2 no-op guard). | 2026-05-23 |
| Zone 1A/1B/1C/1D instrument cluster complete (PRs #484–#487) | All four co-primary instruments shipped: `TrajectoryView.tsx` (Zone 1A — ComposedChart, 4 active + 4 ghost Lines, divergence fills, CVD-safe framework colors, Mode 1 custom tick, (exp) badge, Path A dashed curves); `MDAAlertPanelZone1B.tsx` (Zone 1B — TERMINAL→CRITICAL→WARNING sort, compact 3-line at <320px / full-density at ≥320px, mode-specific tense, negotiation labels, causal attribution Mode 3 only); `PMMWidgetZone1C.tsx` (Zone 1C — mode-specific label, direction arrow, pending state at 40% opacity); `FourFrameworkZone1D.tsx` (Zone 1D — 4 framework scores derived from Zustand atom, null→`score-value--null`+"—", numeric→`score-value--numeric`). Store extended: `Zone1BAlert`, `mda_alerts`, `pmm_value`, `pmm_direction`, `setPmmState`. 104/104 Vitest tests passing. All Playwright E2E guards use isVisible no-op pattern pending App.tsx integration (#463). | 2026-05-23 |
| TrajectoryView Zone 1A merged (PR #484, closes #460) | `TrajectoryView.tsx` (ComposedChart: 4 active Lines, 4 ghost Lines, Area divergence fills, ecological WARNING ReferenceLine, ADR-007-gated band infrastructure, Mode 1 custom tick, (exp) badge, Path A single-entity dashed curves); `InstrumentCluster.tsx` (two-column layout 480/240/280px at 1024×768, 580/400/280px at 1280×800, 280px control plane always rendered); `scenarioStepStore.ts` (Zustand atom, single-set() atomicity invariant); `frameworkColors.ts` (UX Designer ruling — teal #1A8FA0 replaces green #3A7A4B after CVD deuteranopia collision identified); DD-012–DD-015 added; FA brief CVD Validation Result recorded; MV-001 closed; 31/31 Vitest tests passing; AC-003/004/005 Playwright guards added (element not in App.tsx yet); MV-002 hardware validation pending before M9 exits. | 2026-05-23 |
| Known Issues registry established — distinct category from near-misses (PR #482) | External infrastructure limitations (GitHub Actions, third-party APIs) cannot be fixed by process redesign — filing them as near-misses produces improvement recommendations against things we cannot change. Known Issues live in `docs/process/known-issues-registry.md`; near-misses in `docs/process/near-miss-registry.md`. Categorisation rule: if the fix requires changing our own code/process → near-miss; if the fix requires waiting for an upstream vendor → Known Issue. KI-001 filed: GitHub Actions `pull_request` event silently fails to fire (workaround: empty retriggering commit). CLAUDE.md, agents.md, agent-raci.md all updated. | 2026-05-23 |
| Instrument cluster spec retrofit — blanket skip removed, Type 1/Type 2 split completed (PR #480, closes #473) | `instrument-cluster.spec.ts` deleted; `instrument-cluster-integration.spec.ts` created with only AC-001 and AC-002 (Type 2 integration-level, individual `test.skip()` per test — no file-level blanket suppression). Component-level ACs (AC-003–AC-014) distributed to implementing issues: AC-003–013 → #460 (TrajectoryView) with full test code; AC-014 + component tests → #462 (PMM + Four-Framework); component tests → #461 (MDA Alert Panel). CI green: no `test.skip(true, ...)` in any instrument cluster spec file. | 2026-05-23 |
| NM-018 filed — hammer-nail: technical panel produced engineering solutions to a process problem (PR #479) | Three technical agents (Architect, Frontend Architect, QA Lead) consulted on skip governance; all three produced engineering solutions (CI guard, skip registry, DOM-presence fixture) to what was a process problem (missing AC categorization rule). PO Agent and UX Designer Agent immediately identified the correct root cause. Root cause of the near-miss: no rule existed requiring PM Agent to evaluate whether panel composition matched the problem's root cause domain, not just its surface presentation. Standing fix: panel composition principle added to PM Agent pre-EL consultation protocol in `docs/process/agents.md §PM Agent — Pre-EL Consultation` between steps 2 and 3. | 2026-05-23 |
| PO Agent standing responsibilities — dual consumer + sequence gate (PR #477, closes #470) | Two non-negotiable standing responsibilities added to PO working agreement: (1) Stories serve QA Lead and Frontend Architect equally — a story too vague for QA to write a meaningful test, or too abstracted for FA to make the right tradeoffs, is a weak story; (2) Stories → tests → implementation sequence gate — the PO owns enforcement; a story session is not complete until the stories doc is merged, a QA test authorship issue is filed blocking implementation, and the issue hierarchy is established. RACI rows 2 and 3 updated: PO consultation trigger now explicitly names QA/FA story consumers. | 2026-05-23 |
| Type 1/Type 2 AC categorization rule — CODING_STANDARDS + QA Lead + PO working agreements (PR #476, closes #474) | Before any QA E2E spec is authored against a multi-component feature, ACs must be categorized: Type 1 (component-level — testable when one component ships alone; lives in implementation task PR scope) vs Type 2 (integration-level — testable only when all named components coexist; lives in dedicated `<feature>-integration.spec.ts`). `test.skip(true, ...)` at file scope is a process violation for any spec containing Type 1 ACs. QA Lead working agreement (new) makes categorization the first standing commitment. PO pre-authorship check added. Documented in `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md §E2E Pre-implementation Test Categorization`. | 2026-05-23 |
| NM-017 filed — story–test–implementation decomposition mismatch (PR #475, anticipatory) | 16 instrument cluster ACs were suppressed by a blanket `test.skip(true, ...)` because zone-level and component-level ACs were bundled in a single spec file while implementation was decomposed into three Task Issues (#460/461/462). Engineering Lead identified the structural gap through governance anxiety about skip management — before any component shipped. Root cause: no AC categorization rule existed. Severity: High (CI blind spot across primary viewport ACs). Response: retrofit Issue #473 + process change Issue #474 (now complete via PR #476). | 2026-05-23 |
| NM-016 + pre-push lint gate added to CLAUDE.md (PR #472, closes #471) | Two parallel agents (Issues #458 and #459) pushed PRs without running `ruff check .` locally. Both failed CI on I001/E501 — trivially preventable in two seconds locally. Root cause: agent prompts specified `pytest` but not `ruff`. Pre-push lint gate added to CLAUDE.md constitution: `cd backend && ruff check . && mypy app/` required before any push touching Python files. Local ruff==0.7.2 is identical to CI-pinned version — no environment gap. NM-016 filed. | 2026-05-23 |
| Backend trajectory endpoint merged (PR #468, closes #458) | `GET /scenarios/{scenario_id}/trajectory` FastAPI endpoint live on main. Key contracts: `SINGLE_ENTITY_REFERENCE_RANGES` dict (gdp_growth, reserve_coverage_months, unemployment_rate, net_enrollment_secondary — health_expenditure excluded as non-monotonic); `normalized_absolute_strategy` function; ecological MDA floor (WARNING at 1.0) built in application code (no M9 DB table); `mda_floors` at response root; `step_significance` from `step_metadata` JSONB; Pydantic v2 schemas (`TrajectoryResponse`, `TrajectoryStep`, `TrajectoryFrameworkPoint`, `MDAFloorRecord`). 13 unit tests in `test_trajectory_endpoint.py`. | 2026-05-23 |
| QA pre-implementation test authorship merged (PR #469, closes #459) | `frontend/tests/e2e/instrument-cluster.spec.ts` — 16 ACs (AC-001 through AC-014) as Playwright E2E gates. All tests wrapped with `test.skip(true, ...)` pending #460/461/462 (this skip is the subject of retrofit Issue #473). `page.emulate()` Puppeteer bug fixed → CDP session (`Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate`). `frontend/src/components/__tests__/TrajectoryView.test.ts` — Vitest unit tests for AC-010/013/015. `backend/tests/fixtures/test_greece_fixture_step_metadata.py` — 13 pytest CI gate tests for AC-012 (step_event_label ≤8 words AND ≤32 chars). `frontend/tests/manual-validation/mv-gates.md` — MV-001/002/003 procedures. | 2026-05-23 |
| Playwright test skip governance — three-agent consultation (anticipatory) | Engineering Lead asked how to prevent `test.skip()` from being abused or forgotten. Architect (skip registry — hermetic), Frontend Architect (DOM-presence fixture — self-healing), and QA Lead (test.fixme() + milestone exit gate) each assessed independently. Unanimous finding: skip must be visible and self-expiring. Key divergence: registry (auditable) vs DOM-presence (no maintenance). Recommendation: DOM-presence as runtime control + test.fixme() for visibility + Type 1/Type 2 discipline as root fix. Root fix (Type 1/Type 2 rule) eliminates the problem structurally — per NM-017, the correct fix is decomposition discipline, not skip governance tooling. | 2026-05-23 |
| PM Agent pre-EL consultation — standing automatic capability (PR #466, closes #464) | Pre-EL consultation added to PM Agent working agreement as automatic standing responsibility. Three trigger conditions: [EL-DECISION] tag in any document; pending entry in SESSION_STATE.md §Pending EL Decisions; any agent raising an EL-authority question. Four-step process: identify → activate independently → synthesize → surface recommendation. RACI framing: EL holds A; PM Agent holds R for the consultation — cold questions reaching EL without prior consultation are a PM Agent failure. Disagreement handling: PM Agent names divergence and surfaces all positions; does not resolve. | 2026-05-23 |
| Issue hierarchy rule encoded permanently (PR #456); M9 trajectory endpoint epic filed (#457–#463) | Binary three-level issue hierarchy (Epic → Feature → Task) added to PM Agent working agreement in agents.md and referenced in CLAUDE.md. Spawning rule: children created only when >1 agent OR >1 PR required — agent-count-based, not complexity-based. M9 instrument cluster epic #457 filed with six child Feature Issues: #458 (backend trajectory endpoint), #459 (QA test authorship — pre-implementation gate), #460 (TrajectoryView Zone 1A), #461 (MDA Alert Panel Zone 1B), #462 (PMM + Four-Framework Zone 1C/1D), #463 (Greece integration Playwright suite). #459 explicitly blocks #460/461/462. #463 spawns Level 3 Task Issues when prerequisites complete. Pre-EL consultation standing capability filed as #464 — PM Agent auto-coordinates before any EL decision reaches EL. | 2026-05-23 |
| UX-RULING-1/2/3 resolved — QA gate fully unblocked (PR #454) | UX Designer Agent resolved all three open Playwright assertion placeholders in the M9 instrument cluster user stories. RULING-1 (US-016): alert tense markers per mode — Mode 1 `"crossed"`, Mode 2 `"is projected to cross"`, Mode 3 ` — ` separator format; advisory language exclusions. RULING-2 (US-022): null composite score → CSS class `score-value--null` (opacity ≤ 60%); numeric/zero → `score-value--numeric`. RULING-3 (US-026): mode indicator labels — `"Replay"` / `"Simulation"` / `"Active Control"`. All 29 stories now fully testable. QA gate UNBLOCKED. | 2026-05-23 |
| US-GAP-001 — Mode 1 comparable-case comparison deferred to M10 | Pre-EL consultation: UX Design Thinking Agent, PO Agent, Architect Agent — unanimous M10 verdict. Key finding: the gap was narrower than stated. ADR-010 Decision 11 and FA brief §UD-R2 already specify the rendering layer for multi-case Mode 1 (step alignment, stacked entity dates). The missing piece is the Zone 2 entry point for selecting the second fixture — a COMPARE_VIEW architecture question, not an instrument cluster question. Mode 1 block added to `information-hierarchy.md §COMPARE_VIEW` with decision space documented. User stories file updated: US-GAP-001 converted from pending to resolved; M9 service level for Persona 3 stated explicitly (orientation sufficient; comparison M10). Issue #451 filed with full M10 deliverable spec. PR #452. | 2026-05-23 |
| M9 instrument cluster user stories — 29 stories authored (Issue #441, PR #449) | PO Agent: EXECUTE. Two consumers: QA Lead (writes acceptance tests from stories before implementation) and Frontend Architect (implements to stories as user-value specification). 29 stories across 9 groups (US-001–US-029): Zone 1 Completeness, Trajectory View, MDA Alert Panel, PMM Widget, Four-Framework Current Position, Atomicity, Persistent Header, Control Plane Reserved Zone, Performance. All stories include Given/When/Then acceptance criteria tagged by test method [Playwright], [Vitest], [RTL], [pytest], [Manual]. Three [UX-RULING] placeholders (US-016, US-022, US-026) await UX Designer observable-string rulings. One [EL-DECISION] gap finding (US-GAP-001): Andreas Mode 1 comparative-case comparison requires a surface not in M9 spec — EL to decide M9 or M10. File: `docs/ux/user-stories-instrument-cluster-m9.md`. | 2026-05-23 |
| NM-014 systemic root cause expanded — micro-management cycle named | The contributing factor section was accurate but incomplete. Expanded with a full nine-step cycle analysis: mistakes → more prescription → reduced agent reasoning → more mistakes → more prescription. Named the analogy to the tech lead failure mode. Stated the correct structural response: issues carry prescription, standing documents carry rules, agents write their plan before executing, prompts are outcome-oriented. Prescriptive prompting weight upgraded from "under investigation" to "confirmed as significant — both symptom and perpetuating mechanism." PR #447. | 2026-05-23 |
| PR merge gate rule added to CLAUDE.md — mandatory pause + SESSION_STATE.md auto-merge exception | After opening any PR, Claude Code must stop all git operations, report the PR URL, and wait for user merge confirmation before pulling main or starting the next task. Exception: SESSION_STATE.md-only PRs are pre-authorized for auto-merge once the `changes` CI status check passes. Rationale: eliminates the concurrent-terminal race condition (two processes operating git on the same local repo without coordination) while preserving the human as merge coordinator and CI gate — especially important in parallel-session scenarios. PR #445. | 2026-05-23 |
| Branch protection remediation — `changes` and `compliance-scan` added to required status checks | Root-cause analysis of the checkout@v6 CI failure revealed that `changes` (the path-filter gate job) and `compliance-scan` were absent from required status checks. Only `lint`, `test-backend`, and `playwright-e2e` were required — all downstream of `changes`. When `changes` fails, downstream jobs are skipped-due-to-dependency-failure, potentially not blocking merges. Applied immediately via GitHub API (no PR required). Required checks now: `changes`, `test-backend`, `lint`, `playwright-e2e`, `compliance-scan`. NM-015 filed. | 2026-05-23 |
| NM-014 + NM-015 filed — near-miss registry now 15 entries | NM-014: file edit reported as complete without being committed to a branch (agents.md in PO Agent EXECUTE). Process improvement: personal commit gate — a change is not reportable as done until it is on a branch and committed. NM-015: CI gate job (`changes`) was not a required status check; compliance-scan also absent. Process improvement: required checks must include the root gate job, not just its downstream dependents. Milestone exit checklist checkpoint added. PR #443. | 2026-05-23 |
| CI fix — actions/checkout@v6 → @v4 | The April 19 checkout@v6 upgrade was intentional (Node.js 20 deprecation, v6 released January 2026) and appears to have regressed recently. All 7 occurrences across ci.yml and milestone-automation.yml updated to @v4 (current stable). This unblocked PR #443. PR #444. | 2026-05-23 |
| Near-miss registry created — NM-001 through NM-013 | `docs/process/near-miss-registry.md` created using Aviation SMS epistemology: near-misses treated with same rigor as incidents because they reveal hazards without the cost of failure. 7 reactive entries (NM-001–NM-007) + 6 anticipatory entries (NM-008–NM-013). Recurring pattern identified: agent acting in domain belonging to another agent without required consultation (NM-005, NM-006, NM-007). Second pattern: six entries are anticipatory — Engineering Lead sensing structural gaps before failure. Registry maintenance section defines template, severity levels, and the key question: "caught by process or by a person?" PR #435 + PR #436. | 2026-05-23 |

HORIZON mode in `docs/process/agents.md` expanded from one-liner to five numbered sweep steps; step 5 = FILE AUTHORITY AUDIT. PR #432 (CLAUDE.md rule) + PR #433 (table + HORIZON step). | 2026-05-23 |
| Issue #428 prerequisites complete — trajectory endpoint unblocked | (1) ADR-010 D6 amendment: M9 deferral of MDA floors; ecological WARNING at 1.0; M10-B schema. (2) CM reference range consultation: gdp_growth [-0.10, 0.06]; reserve_coverage_months [0.0, 12.0]; unemployment_rate [0.02, 0.30] inverted; net_enrollment_secondary [0.40, 1.00]; health_expenditure excluded; Tier 3 floor. (3) ADR-010 D2 amendment: scoring_basis three-value enum (percentile_rank / normalized_absolute / boundary_proximity); single-entity contract; step_metadata JSONB. DA+Ar review: scoring_basis ecological value corrected to "boundary_proximity" (was "percentile_rank" — semantically incorrect); db_reads M10 comment fix. PR #429 merged. Issue #428 closed. | 2026-05-23 |
| EL Decisions A/B/C recorded — trajectory endpoint implementation unblocked | Decision A: MDA floor overlays deferred to M10; ecological WARNING at 1.0 authorized for M9; CM consultation on reference ranges authorized; M10-B schema confirmed. Decision B: Path A selected — normalized absolute composite for single-entity trajectory; four curves; Tier 3 confidence floor; CM reference range consultation is the hard next gate. Decision C: step_metadata JSONB option (a) confirmed. All recorded on Issue #366. Issue #193 updated. PR #427. | 2026-05-22 |
| Six-agent parallel consultation — DA-F2/F4/F5 pre-implementation record | CM, UX Design Thinking, UX Designer, Data Architect, QA Lead, Frontend Architect activated simultaneously. Key rulings: (1) CM: single-entity normalized absolute composite is methodologically sound (Tier 3 floor); Path A requires pre-declared reference ranges before endpoint can compute. (2) CM: composite-score MDA floors cannot be defined without backtesting — defer to M10; ecological WARNING at 1.0 is only M9 exception. (3) UT: four-curve Mode 1 Greece is M9 exit requirement; DA-F4 is demo scope decision. (4) UD: Path A rulings (strokeDasharray="8 3", legend labels, tooltip) and Path B rulings (40px amber strip, approved text) recorded. (5) DA: step_metadata JSONB confirmed valid; scoring_basis field for Path A; single_entity_advisory at response root for Path B; mda_floors structural error in stub identified. (6) QA: AC-009 corrected (3 shock ReferenceLines, not 6+); AC-015 broadened to all four Lines. (7) FA: atom unchanged for all paths; connectNulls={false} confirmed on all 8 Lines; single_entity_advisory must not be atom field. Three EL decisions still pending. PR #426. | 2026-05-22 |
| Architect Agent review of Data Architect findings — three EL decisions required | Data Architect found 5 schema gaps (DA-F1–F5). Architect dispositions: DA-F1 stub adequate; DA-F2 defer MDA floor overlays to M10 + CM consultation; DA-F3 correct as-is; DA-F4 CRITICAL (Greece Mode 1 blocked — single-entity null; CM + ADR-010 amendment required); DA-F5 step_metadata JSONB approach confirmed.

| ADR-008 drafted — PR #416 | Architect Agent: EXECUTE activated. Read all required documents (backlog, agent-raci, Issue #364, first-principles-depth, north-star, information-hierarchy, user-journeys). 17 decisions covering viewport inversion, zone assignments, all three modes, blue/orange cross-layer visual system, confidence tier differentiation, Mode 1 step annotation (fixture CI gate), live A/B comparison (automatic), control plane reserved zone. Status: Proposed — pending four-member panel review (UX Designer, Frontend Architect, Chief Methodologist, Engineering Lead). | 2026-05-22 |
| RACI-grounded ADR panel composition rule — added to #405 scope | ADR-008 panel omitted Frontend Architect despite FA being C on all architectural decisions per agent-raci.md row 1. Root cause: panel copied from M8 critique panel (conceptual framing question) rather than derived from the RACI. Rule added to Issue #405 scope: before naming any ADR panel, consult agent-raci.md; any R or C agent must be included or exclusion documented. Implementing agent is always required. Minimum panels by ADR type: frontend ADR → Frontend Architect; engine ADR → Chief Engineer; data ADR → Chief Methodologist; UX ADR → UX Designer. ADR-008 (Issue #397) is the first application of the corrected rule — FA already added to that panel this session. | 2026-05-22 |
| M12 renamed — "Active Control and External Sector" | Previous GitHub title "Analyst Tooling and External Sector" undersold Mode 3; roadmap doc used a third variant "Transformation and External Sector". Renamed to "Active Control and External Sector" — names the two user-facing deliverables (Mode 3 and the external sector module) without naming the matrix engine migration as the lead. GitHub milestone description field also confirmed stale. Milestone registry gap filed as #412 (M9, near-term). | 2026-05-22 |

| EL Decisions 1/2/3 recorded — Issue #364 closed; Issue #365 unblocked; four gap issues filed | Decision 1 (north-star): per-mode formulation adopted — Mode 1: trajectory reconstruction AND historical pattern recognition; Mode 2: threshold-safe path construction; Mode 3: real-time steering within human cost constraints. All 13 marquee cases validated. Two M11 gaps correctly surfaced (Argentina/Ukraine political economy constraint); two engineering gaps filed (#393 Mode 1→2 transition, #394 multi-scenario comparison). Decision 2 (viewport): instrument cluster as primary viewport adopted; EntityDetailDrawer demoted to detail/methodology; entity selector as persistent header element. Decision 3 (comparison): conditional switch extended to Mode 3 — automatic live A/B with no invoke required; DeltaChoropleth deprecated for single-entity and Mode 3. Four gap issues: #392 (M11 political economy), #393 (Mode 1→2 transition), #394 (multi-scenario), #395 (step_event_label mandatory). Issue #364 closed.

| Issue #363 implemented — UX first-principles depth (PR #390 merged) | docs/ux/design-thinking/worldsim-ux-architecture-first-principles-depth.md. Six gaps closed. Gap 1A: Mode 3 walkthrough for Eleni (February 2012), 10-component Frontend Architect requirement table. Gap 1B: mandatory Mode 1 step axis annotation — three fixture fields (effective_from, step_event_label, step_significance); missing step_event_label on SIGNIFICANT steps is an incomplete fixture. Gap 2: three analogy breaks qualified (atomic simultaneous updates; entity selector always visible; Tier 4 instrument visual differentiation). Gap 3: blue/orange cross-layer visual system for policy inputs vs. exogenous shocks; causal attribution in alert text is the negotiating instrument. Gap 4: Mode 3 live A/B comparison is automatic — any control input creates the split; ghost baseline at 50% opacity with divergence fill region. Gap 5: mode transition design — persistent vs. mode-specific instruments; single modal confirmation only for unsaved state loss. Revised six governing premises: Premise 3 mandated with Mode 1 step annotation (most consequential); Premise 4 extended for multiple Mode 1 cognitive tasks; Premise 6 new (methodology as Zone 2 mandatory). Issue #364 unblocked. | 2026-05-21 |

Three activations: UX Design Thinking Agent (Q1–Q3), Development Economist (Eleni February 2012 walkthrough), Political Economist (Andreas Preparatory state). Key finding: Case B holds for all five personas architecturally; four specification extensions required. Most consequential: step axis annotation (calendar date + event label) is mandatory in Mode 1 — without it, Premises 3 optimizes for Personas 1 and 2 while Personas 3 and 5 cannot orient. Issue #363 must accompany Persona 2 Gap 1 walkthrough with parallel Mode 1 specification for Persona 3 pattern recognition. | 2026-05-21 |

| UX first principles review completed — Case B verdict (PR #356) | docs/ux/design-thinking/worldsim-ux-architecture-first-principles.md. Root finding: current UI inverts instrument/context relationship (choropleth primary, instruments in drawer). Mode 3 active control requires instruments always visible — current architecture fails this. Case B: rethink warranted before M9. Minimum rethink = three document changes + reserved control plane zone. Five M9 governing premises produced. Highest-priority action: update information-hierarchy.md governing principle. Decision 2 (timeline zone assignment) reframed as wrong question — defer and address as viewport architecture question. | 2026-05-18 |
| M8 UX panel synthesis completed (PR #356) | Three-agent panel (UX Designer, Development Economist, Chief Methodologist) independently reviewed Design Thinking Agent M8 critique (PR #355). Nine cross-cutting concerns; three EL decisions required; four premises revised/rejected; six premises unanimously confirmed; six additive findings. Highest-priority EL decision: north-star.md Primary Cognitive Task formulation — load-bearing for all hierarchy changes. | 2026-05-18 |
| UX Design Thinking Agent activated (PR #353/#354/#355) | Issue #353 filed; agent persona added to agents.md (PR #354); M8 critique produced at docs/ux/design-thinking/m8-interaction-model-critique.md (PR #355). Core diagnosis: WorldSim is a spatial comparison tool applied to a temporal problem; trajectory view should be Zone 1B primary instrument. | 2026-05-18 |
| M8 DEMO issues filed (PR #351) | All nine IR findings filed as GitHub issues #342–#350; assigned to M8 milestone. Root Cause B (#343 DEMO-002) is highest-priority: resolves DEMO-002/003/005/006 simultaneously. IR review updated with issue numbers. | 2026-05-18 |

| M8 IR Agent review completed (PR #340) | Nine findings (DEMO-001–009); 2 CRITICAL, 4 SIGNIFICANT, 3 MINOR. Root Cause B (drawer too narrow/dense) explains DEMO-002/003/005/006 simultaneously — highest-priority fix. docs/demo/m8/reviews/2026-05-18-v0.8.0-stakeholder-review.md. | 2026-05-18 |
| M8 demo polish fixes merged (PR #340) | gdp_growth choropleth error fixed (switch after step 1); drawer opened at step 4 for primary surplus narration; compare scenario extended to 6 steps with matching initial_attributes so DeltaChoropleth has step 6 data. | 2026-05-18 |
| M8 milestone board cleanup (this session) | Exit checklists #261–#264 and #213 were systematically off-by-one milestone; corrected. #286/#299/#301 re-milestoned to M9; #217/#95 re-milestoned to M10. #142 closed (stale). | 2026-05-18 |
| Demo preparation standard established (PR #334) | docs/process/demo-preparation-standard.md defines the biennial demo cadence. M6 artifacts archived to docs/demo/m6/. M8 screenshot brief (UX Agent) saved to docs/demo/m8/screenshot-brief.md. Thesis frame: Frame C, Step 5 (2014) — asymmetric radar. | 2026-05-18 |
| Python 3.12 Docker fix merged (PR #336, closes #332) | Rebuilt image on python:3.12-slim (confirmed 3.12.13 in container). Added `sys.version_info < (3, 12)` startup guard to app/main.py (# noqa: UP036 — ruff UP036 fires because target-version=py312, guard is operationally needed for stale images). Documented `docker compose build api` in CONTRIBUTING.md Step 3. | 2026-05-18 |
| EcologicalModule delta path bug fixed (PR #328) | For STOCK indicators, emit new absolute value (current + elasticity_delta) not the raw delta. The propagation engine replaces STOCK attributes — emitting the raw ~-0.08 elasticity value would overwrite the 388 ppm seed with a tiny negative, corrupting all subsequent proximity computations. | 2026-05-18 |
| gdp_direction_step5_positive deferred to Issue #221 | MacroeconomicModule has no endogenous recovery mechanism; fiscal consolidation accumulates without rebound channel. Engine produces -0.434 at step 5 vs historical +0.007. Moved from blocking CI gate to deferred_thresholds. | 2026-05-18 |
| co2_concentration_ppm seed (388 ppm, NOAA MLO 2010) required for demo scenario | Without seed, EcologicalModule stock path has no attribute at step 1 → null proximity. Added to build_greece_demo_scenario() initial_attributes. | 2026-05-18 |

## Architectural State — Key Facts for Session Continuity

**ADR-007 Synthetic Data Framework — accepted ✅ (PR #510). Live in `docs/adr/ADR-007-synthetic-data-framework.md`.**

- Five-method hierarchy: Bayesian Structural (Method A, requires ≥10 comparables + holdout) → MICE (Method B, bounded gap ≤3 periods) → Bootstrap Resampling (Method C) → Structural Extrapolation (Method D) → Structural Absence (Method E, generates bounds only)
- Quantity schema extension (4 new fields — M10 implementation prerequisite, Alembic migration required): `is_synthetic: bool`, `synthetic_method: str | None`, `comparison_group_id: str | None`, `holdout_validated: bool | None`
- MDA alert behavior: Tier 3 → advisory amber dashed in primary cluster; Tier 4 → exploratory signal secondary panel only; Tier 5 → no alert; CI straddling MDA floor → blue "Cannot determine MDA status" in primary cluster
- Comparison group registry: follows `source_registry` pattern, new table required before Method A deployment, managed by Data Quality Agent (Issue #300)
- Anomaly detection: opt-in, Modes 1+2 only, TSC sign-off before production, governance indicators permanently excluded
- Panel review artifact: `docs/adr/reviews/ADR-007-panel-review.md`. Mermaid diagram: `docs/architecture/ADR-007-method-selection-flowchart.mmd`

**ADR-005 Amendment 4 — GovernanceModule PROMOTED ✅ (PR #585, Issue #556). Governance axis live as of M10.**

- All five promotion criteria met at M10. Governance composite live via `normalized_absolute_strategy`.
- `SINGLE_ENTITY_GUARD_EXEMPT_FRAMEWORKS = frozenset({"ecological", "governance"})` — governance exempt from single-entity null suppression and single-entity note.
- `_UNIMPLEMENTED_FRAMEWORKS = set()` — empty; governance removed at promotion.
- Three elasticities: `gdp_growth_change→rule_of_law_percentile` (-0.08), `imf_program_acceptance→democratic_quality_score` (+0.005), `emergency_declaration→democratic_quality_score` (-0.05; Bermeo 2016).
- MDA threshold seeded: `MDA-GOV-DEMOCRACY-FLOOR` — `democratic_quality_score ≤ 0.70 → WARNING` (migration `e3b7f1c9d5a2`).
- Greece M10 demo fixture: WGI 2010 rule-of-law seed (60.0), V-Dem 2010 LDI seed (0.72), `emergency_declaration` at step 5 → MDA alert fires step 6.
- `EmergencyInstrument.EMERGENCY_DECLARATION = "emergency_declaration"` added to enum.
- `FourFrameworkZone1D.tsx`: `(in validation)` annotation removed (IR-005 resolved).
- `greenlet==3.1.1` added to requirements.txt (SQLAlchemy async on Python 3.13 CI).
- Promotion gate tests in `test_measurement_output.py` removed; replaced by backtesting integration test.

**PMM live computation — merged ✅ (PR #587, Issue #496 IR-002). Breach-exclusion fix — PR #650 (closes #648):**
- `PMMRecord` schema: `value` (Decimal-as-str, [0,1]) + `direction` ("up"/"down"/"flat")
- `TrajectoryStep.pmm: PMMRecord | None` — null when no applicable threshold has matching indicator, OR when all thresholds are already breached
- `_pmm_indicator_margin()`: [0,1] headroom for one threshold; approach window = `floor * approach_pct`; both `lte` (lower-bound) and `gte` (upper-bound) operators supported
- `_compute_pmm_for_step()`: **skips breached thresholds (margin == 0)**; min-of-margins across non-breached applicable thresholds; returns None when all thresholds breached (displayed as "—"); direction from prev-step delta vs ±0.01; cohort-scoped thresholds skipped; entity-scoped thresholds matched by exact entity_id
- MDA thresholds fetched once per trajectory request (not per step)
- Argentina Demo 3 PMM path: Steps 0–1 ≈ 0.2857 (governance headroom; ecological CO2 breach excluded), Step 2 ≈ 0.4286 (↑ Kirchner recovery improvement), Steps 3–4 = None / "—" (governance threshold breached by emergency_declaration at step 2)
- Frontend: `useEffect([currentStep, store.trajectory])` in `ScenarioInstrumentCluster` syncs `pmm_value`/`pmm_direction` to Zustand store; `TrajectoryStep` store type extended with `pmm` field
- 31 unit tests: `backend/tests/unit/test_pmm_computation.py` (3 new breach-exclusion tests replace old `test_min_across_thresholds`)

**ADR-001 + ADR-002 — renewed ✅ (PR #661). Valid Until Milestone 11.**

- No renewal triggers fired in M10. ADR-001: no schema changes. ADR-002: GovernanceModule `EMERGENCY_DECLARATION` is an internal enum, not a ControlInput taxonomy addition.
- M10 exit review entries added (SCAN-024, 2026-06-03).

**ADR-005 — Amendment 5 appended ✅ (PR #661). Valid Until Milestone 11.**

- GovernanceModule M10 promotion formally recorded: all 5/5 criteria met.
- M9 obligations discharged: normalization audit complete; tooltip annotation removed (IR-005, #499).

**ADR-007 — renewed ✅ (PR #661). Valid Until Milestone 11.**

- Not implemented in M10. No Quantity schema changes. No triggers fired.

**ADR-008 — renewed ✅ (PR #661). Valid Until Milestone 11.**

- step_event_label content fix ≠ schema rename (trigger requires rename/retype/removal). Zone 1 implementation per spec is not a trigger. AC-006 RTL confirms simultaneous update contract.

**ADR-010 — renewed ✅ (PR #661). Valid Until Milestone 11.**

- PMM API extension fields (`pmm_value`, `pmm_direction`) not consumed by TrajectoryView — Zone 1A data contract unchanged. Note: ADR-009 streaming decision may trigger shared state architecture trigger in M11.

**ADR-005 Amendment 3 — merged ✅ (PR #309). Now live in `docs/adr/ADR-005-human-cost-ledger.md`.**

**M8 demo scenario — merged ✅ (PR #328). Implements Issue #269:**
- `build_greece_demo_scenario()` in `tests/fixtures/greece_2010_scenario.py`
- EcologicalModule enabled via `modules_config: {ecological: {enabled: True}}`
- CO2 seed: `co2_concentration_ppm = 388.0 ppm` (NOAA MLO 2010) in initial_attributes
- 5 backtesting tests in `tests/backtesting/test_greece_m8_demo.py`
- CLI demo: `backend/scripts/demo_greece_2010_2015.py`
- `gdp_direction_step5_positive` moved to deferred_thresholds (Issue #221)
- EcologicalModule STOCK delta path: emits `current + elasticity_delta` (not raw delta)

**M8 ecological backend — merged ✅ (PR #324). Implements Issues #312, #313, #314:**
- `_compute_composite_score` now async with three-branch dispatch; ecological uses `_boundary_proximity_strategy`
- `_ECOLOGICAL_MANDATORY_NOTE_TEMPLATE` with `{n_indicators}` slot
- `_SINGLE_ENTITY_GUARD_EXEMPT_FRAMEWORKS = frozenset({"ecological", "governance"})` — both exempt from single-entity null suppression (governance added M10 PR #585)
- Migrations: `c1a4e7f2d9b3` (confidence_tier), `d2b5f8a3e6c4` (ecological MDA thresholds)
- EcologicalModule: stock-path proximity computation from `entity.attributes`; temporal guards per `effective_from`
- `land_use_pressure_index` proximity uses `min(v, 2.0)` — no division by 0.25 (double-normalization prevention)

**M8 frontend UX — merged ✅ (PR #329). Implements Issues #317, #318, #319, #320:**
- `INDICATOR_DISPLAY_NAMES` registry in `RadarChart.tsx` — human-readable labels for all M8 indicators
- Zone 3A expandable ecological note — `EcologicalNoteDrawer` component
- PMM Zone 1C widget — `PolicyManoeuvreMeter` null placeholder (M8 scope)
- Radar chart 250ms CSS transition animation — `prefers-reduced-motion` + null-axis guard

**Frontend — null governance axis (Issue #315, PR #323 ✅ merged):**
- `RadarAxisDatum.composite_score: number | null` live on main
- `GOVERNANCE_IN_VALIDATION_LABEL` + `GOVERNANCE_IN_VALIDATION_TOOLTIP` exported constants
- `computeFinalScore(composite_score: number | null, weight: number): number | null` exported pure function
- Null axis: dashed hollow SVG circle (`strokeDasharray="2 2"`, `fill="none"`); Recharts polygon gap
- DD-011 in `docs/frontend/design-decisions.md` with sentinel

**M8 UX Design Thinking work stream — complete (PRs #355, #356):**
- Critique: `docs/ux/design-thinking/m8-interaction-model-critique.md` — six ranked premise changes; core diagnosis: WorldSim is spatial comparison tool applied to temporal problem
- Panel synthesis: `docs/ux/design-thinking/m8-critique-panel-synthesis.md` — three-agent panel; nine cross-cutting concerns; three EL decisions
- First principles review: `docs/ux/design-thinking/worldsim-ux-architecture-first-principles.md` — supersedes synthesis on conflicts
  - Case B verdict: architecture rethink before M9 implementation
  - Root finding: choropleth (context) occupies primary viewport; instruments (radar, PMM, MDA alerts) are in 25% drawer — inverted
  - Four primary flight instruments named (trajectory view, PMM, MDA alerts, four-framework current position) — all must be always visible without drawer
  - Decision 1 (north-star formulation): extend to per-mode tasks, not single formulation
  - Decision 2 (timeline zone assignment): wrong question — defer, reframe as viewport architecture question
  - Decision 3 (compare mode conditional): correct question — add Mode 3 case (always temporal, never choropleth)
  - Five M9 governing premises: (1) instruments in primary viewport, (2) instruments always visible without drawer, (3) step axis is shared frame for all instruments, (4) primary cognitive task per mode, (5) control plane reserved in layout before built
  - Highest-priority action: update information-hierarchy.md governing principle
- UX Design Thinking Agent persona: `docs/process/agents.md` — activation: `UX Design Thinking Agent: CRITIQUE — [scope]`

**Demo preparation standard — established ✅ (PR #334):**
- `docs/process/demo-preparation-standard.md` — nine-step biennial demo cadence; reference cases M6 (#220) and M8 (#333)
- `docs/demo/m6/` — M6 review and walkthrough archived
- `docs/demo/m8/screenshot-brief.md` — UX Agent five-frame brief for Issue #233
- Thesis frame: Frame C, Step 5 (2014) — asymmetric radar (financial partial recovery, HD depressed)
- Presentation sequence: C → A → B → D → E (lead with thesis)
- #233 closed ✅ — demo.sh updated, spec rewritten (M8), five frames captured, IR Agent review filed
- IR review: `docs/demo/m8/reviews/2026-05-18-v0.8.0-stakeholder-review.md` — 9 findings, issues TBF
- `docs/demo/stakeholder-walkthrough.md` is M6-era — needs M8 update before next review cycle
